# MTT Selected H Radial Transport Map or DynamicPhiFinC1Consumer v1

## Theorem

`HRadialTransportCoefficientIsolationTheorem` is emitted.

## Transport Contract

The `D_211/pi^2` clue suggests the natural radial transport form:

```text
r_H = pi^4 * tau_H
N_H = pi^8 * tau_H^2
```

For the controlled H layer:

```text
r_H              = 391.39140285811936
N_H              = 153187.2302312467
pi^4             = 97.40909103400243
tau_H required   = 4.018017196377461
```

This is progress because the unknown is now isolated as a single transport
coefficient `tau_H`.

## Diagnostics

```text
-logdet(D_211) candidate = 4.019441578939575
relative residual        = 0.00035449887158218763
integer 4 residual       = 0.004484101360667441
```

Neither is accepted as a source.

## Dynamic PhiFin/C1 Consumer Retest

The dynamic `Phi_fin/C1` value table remains ready, and local axiom conditional
closure remains available.  But strict closure still has:

```text
selected_dynamic_phi_fin_c1_payload_emitted = false
typed_HRG_consumer_map_emitted              = false
accepted_HRG_consumer_count                 = 0
```

The `D_211/pi^2` clue adds a sharper radial normalization target, but it does
not by itself emit the consumer map.
