# q79 Bulk-to-Boundary Dirac Family Functor and Boundary-Source Cutset Theorem

## 1. Claim boundary

This theorem closes two previously separate questions under `B.QFT.02`.

First, once a physical moving-boundary package is supplied, the selected q79
bulk Dirac operator canonically produces the tangential Dirac family, its APS
projectors and its BFV Green form. Arbitrary finite operator entries are not
additional source data.

Second, the earlier finite crossing

\[
A(t)=\operatorname{diag}(-2,t,3)
\]

is the endpoint of an explicit spectral-flow-preserving homotopy from a
three-mode Galerkin restriction of a continuum Dirac operator on the shared
circle.

The theorem does **not** select the physical moving boundary, connection
history, endpoint comparison or full Dai--Freed phase.

## 2. Current selected bulk data

After `A_QG` and `A_causal`, the current q79 branch supplies:

1. a globally hyperbolic, time-oriented Lorentzian background
   \((Y_4,g,e)\), up to diffeomorphism and local Lorentz gauge;
2. the framed spinor bundle and parallel q79 finite bundle;
3. the zero-order-free minimally coupled Dirac operator
   \[
   D_{\rm q79}
   =
   i\gamma^a e_a{}^\mu
   \left(
   \nabla_\mu^{\rm LC,spin}\otimes 1
   +
   1\otimes\nabla_\mu^{\rm q79}
   \right);
   \]
4. one auxiliary rounded-region APS package used by the regulator proof;
5. the finite q79 shared sign holonomy \(-1\).

The rounded regulator boundary is explicitly auxiliary. The coframe and causal
orientation do not select a compact noncollar boundary path.

## 3. Conditional bulk-to-boundary functor

Let the additional boundary package be

\[
\mathcal B=
\left(
j_s,\ {\rm coorientation},\ \kappa_s,\
\nabla_s^\partial,\ T_{\rm end},\ \tau_s
\right),
\tag{3.1}
\]

where:

- \(j_s:\Sigma\to Y_4\) is a smooth family of compact cooriented
  hypersurface embeddings;
- \(\kappa_s\) is a compatible collar/productization, or an equivalent fixed
  adapted-operator convention;
- \(\nabla_s^\partial\) is the restricted physical SpinC/q79 connection
  history;
- \(T_{\rm end}\) is the endpoint comparison when the family is a loop only
  modulo gauge;
- \(\tau_s\) is the zero-mode taming or BFV polarization.

The coorientation and bulk metric determine the unit normal \(\nu_s\). The
boundary Clifford bundle is

\[
E_s=j_s^*(S\otimes F_{\rm q79}).
\tag{3.2}
\]

For tangential covectors \(\xi\), the adapted boundary symbol is

\[
\sigma_{B_s}(x,\xi)
=
\sigma_D(x,\nu_s)^{-1}\sigma_D(x,\xi).
\tag{3.3}
\]

With the declared product-collar convention,

\[
D_{\rm q79}
=
\sigma_D(\nu_s)\left(\partial_r+B_s\right).
\tag{3.4}
\]

Thus \(D_{\rm q79}\) and \(\mathcal B\) determine:

\[
P_s^{\rm APS}=\mathbf 1_{(-\infty,0)}(B_s),
\tag{3.5}
\]

with zero modes assigned by \(\tau_s\), and the boundary Green/BFV form

\[
\beta_s(\phi,\psi)
=
\int_\Sigma
\left\langle
\sigma_D(\nu_s)\phi,\psi
\right\rangle\,d\mu_s.
\tag{3.6}
\]

Equation (3.6) is understood up to the standard overall sign or factor of
\(i\) fixed by the declared Green-form convention.

At an isolated regular crossing \(s_*\), the crossing space is

\[
K_{s_*}=\ker B_{s_*}.
\tag{3.7}
\]

Spin-lift, connection and coorientation preserving ambient isotopies conjugate
this complete package. Therefore the map

\[
(Y_4,g,e,D_{\rm q79};\mathcal B)
\longmapsto
(E_s,B_s,P_s^{\rm APS},\beta_s,K_{s_*})
\tag{3.8}
\]

is canonical at the declared analytic tier. It is a functor from supplied
boundary geometry, not a rule selecting \(\mathcal B\).

## 4. Exact continuum crossing

Use \(S^1_{\rm shared}\) only as a compact holonomy/Fourier model. It is not
physical time and is not the full three-dimensional spatial boundary.

On periodic spinors, define

\[
B_a=-i\frac{d}{d\theta}+a.
\tag{4.1}
\]

For

\[
\phi_n(\theta)=e^{in\theta},
\qquad n\in\mathbb Z,
\]

one has the exact spectrum

\[
B_a\phi_n=(n+a)\phi_n.
\tag{4.2}
\]

Take the unit-winding path

\[
a(u)=\frac12+u,
\qquad 0\leq u\leq1.
\tag{4.3}
\]

Both endpoints have holonomy \(-1\). They are gauge equivalent because, for
\(U(\theta)=e^{i\theta}\),

\[
U B_{3/2}U^{-1}=B_{1/2}.
\tag{4.4}
\]

Only the mode \(n=-1\) crosses zero:

\[
\lambda_{-1}(a)=a-1.
\tag{4.5}
\]

Indeed,

\[
n\leq-2
\Longrightarrow
n+a\leq-\frac12<0,
\]

and

\[
n\geq0
\Longrightarrow
n+a\geq\frac12>0.
\]

At \(a=1\),

\[
K_{\rm circ}
=
\operatorname{span}_{\mathbb C}(e^{-i\theta}),
\qquad
\Gamma|_{K_{\rm circ}}=+1.
\tag{4.6}
\]

Consequently,

\[
\operatorname{sf}(B_{a(u)})=+1.
\tag{4.7}
\]

This is a continuum differential-operator realization of the simple crossing,
not a selected physical q79 boundary history.

## 5. Exact Galerkin reduction

Set

\[
t=2(a-1),
\qquad -1\leq t\leq1.
\tag{5.1}
\]

Restrict \(B_a\) to the Fourier modes

\[
n=-3,-1,2.
\]

The exact Galerkin family is

\[
G(t)
=
\operatorname{diag}
\left(
-2+\frac t2,\,
\frac t2,\,
3+\frac t2
\right).
\tag{5.2}
\]

For \(0\leq r\leq1\), define

\[
H_r(t)
=
\operatorname{diag}
\left(
-2+\frac{(1-r)t}{2},\,
\frac{1+r}{2}t,\,
3+\frac{(1-r)t}{2}
\right).
\tag{5.3}
\]

Then

\[
H_0(t)=G(t),
\qquad
H_1(t)=\operatorname{diag}(-2,t,3).
\tag{5.4}
\]

Throughout the homotopy,

\[
-2+\frac{(1-r)t}{2}\leq-\frac32<0,
\]

\[
3+\frac{(1-r)t}{2}\geq\frac52>0,
\]

and

\[
\frac{1+r}{2}>0.
\]

No spectator mode crosses zero and the central crossing remains regular and
positive. Hence the finite witness and the continuum Galerkin family have the
same spectral flow \(+1\). The finite witness is no longer an arbitrary matrix:
it is an exact spectrally flattened local model of (4.1).

## 6. Exact boundary-path nonselection

At the same sign-holonomy basepoint, compare:

\[
a_0(u)=\frac12
\]

and

\[
a_1(u)=\frac12+u
\quad\text{modulo the endpoint gauge map }U.
\]

The first path has spectral flow zero. The second has spectral flow one.
They use the same:

- circle metric;
- periodic spin structure;
- q79 sign-holonomy basepoint;
- endpoint gauge class.

Therefore endpoint sign holonomy and bulk geometry do not determine the
classifying loop, its spectral flow or its crossing line.

`A_causal` can orient an already supplied physical evolution. It does not
identify compact circle phase with noncompact physical time, and it does not
emit the missing boundary loop. Thus:

```text
B.QFT.02_bulk_only_boundary_family_selection
  = excluded_by_same_basepoint_sf_zero_vs_one_counterfamily.
```

## 7. Revised source contract

The first physical source row is now exactly:

```text
selected boundary source package
  = moving cooriented embedding
  + collar/adapted-operator convention
  + restricted physical connection history
  + endpoint comparison and zero-mode taming.
```

Once this package is supplied, the boundary operator, APS projector, BFV form
and crossing kernel are outputs, not fitted matrices.

The remaining physical phase still requires:

1. the selected package above;
2. the resulting physical crossing line;
3. a unitary parallel intertwiner from that line to the q79 shared line;
4. analytic determinant-line transgression;
5. eta, Maslov, BFV and finite-counterterm normalization.

## 8. Theorem

The selected q79 bulk Dirac data define a canonical bulk-to-boundary
Dirac/APS/BFV functor after the typed package (3.1) is supplied. The previous
finite crossing is exactly homotopic, through one-crossing self-adjoint
families, to a three-mode Galerkin restriction of the continuum circle Dirac
family (4.1). However, current q79 bulk geometry and sign holonomy admit both
spectral-flow-zero and spectral-flow-one loops. They therefore cannot select
the physical noncollar boundary family.

Accordingly:

```text
B.QFT.02_bulk_to_boundary_Dirac_BFV_functor
  = closed_conditional_exact_after_boundary_source_package

B.QFT.02_finite_crossing_differential_operator_origin
  = closed_exact_by_circle_Fourier_Galerkin_homotopy

B.QFT.02_selected_physical_noncollar_boundary_family
  = open_reduced_to_typed_boundary_source_package

B.QFT.02_full_relative_Dai_Freed_phase
  = open.
```

## 9. Parameter ledger

```text
new physical continuous parameters: 0
new physical discrete selectors:    0
new fits:                            0
new observed inputs:                 0
```

The rational coordinates \(1/2,1,3/2\) are exact witness coordinates. The
winding is deliberately not promoted as a selected physical q79 datum.
