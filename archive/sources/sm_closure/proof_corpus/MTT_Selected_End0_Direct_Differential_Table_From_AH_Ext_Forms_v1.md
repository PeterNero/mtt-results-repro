# MTT Selected End0 Direct Differential Table From AH Ext Forms v1

## Claim

The direct `End_0(V_alpha)` route now has a symbolic local-form bridge:

```text
eta = theta_plus_0(z1) tensor eta_minus_0(z2) dbar_z2
```

This corresponds to the selected first Ext slot
`theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_0` in the eight-dimensional
`H^1(X,L^2)` packet.  Appell-Humbert data supplies the ordered `L^2=(2,-4,0)`
transition seed and curvature row.

## What Closes

- The AH/Appell-Humbert transition seed for `L^2` is recorded.
- The selected Ext cohomology slot is lifted to a symbolic local-form template.
- The direct `End_0` operator template is:

```text
barpartial_End0 = barpartial_Iwasawa + ad(A_split_AH + eta_offdiag + HYM_correction)
```

## What Does Not Close

This is not yet a Newton-ready table.  The symbolic Ext representative must be
normalized into an actual local table: theta basis, overlap/trivialization
rules, partition-of-unity or equivalent Dolbeault representative, and Hermitian
normalization.  The HYM correction, Hodge/Lambda, quadrature, and gauge
projector tables are also still open.
