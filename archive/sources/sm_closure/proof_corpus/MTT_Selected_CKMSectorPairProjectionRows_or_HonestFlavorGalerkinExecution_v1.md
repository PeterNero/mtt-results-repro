# MTT Selected CKMSectorPairProjectionRows or HonestFlavorGalerkinExecution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_CKMSECTORPAIR_PROJECTION_CONTRACT_CLOSED_WEIGHT_SOURCE_ROWS_OPEN`.

## Theorem

`CKMSectorPairProjectionRowContractTheorem` is proved.

The exact CKM correction problem is now reduced to three finite q=448
sector-pair weights:

```text
C_ij = 1 + W_ij / 448
```

For the current replay obligation those weights would be:

```text
W12 = 1.412367346933010
W23 = 6.829844553504131
W13 = 23.108007593901789
```

These are not promoted as source values. They are the target-independent shape
of the missing row evaluator plus the postcheck obligation.

## What Closed

- finite q=448 correction normalization;
- row names `Pi_CKM^12`, `Pi_CKM^23`, `Pi_CKM^13`;
- selected inputs feeding the contract: heavy-link `Delta_v`, q79 phase, and
  the dynamic C1 domain.

## What Remains

Accepted selected weight rows: `0/3`.

The finite source-basis projection attempt found near-hits only. The remaining
exact object is a selected source theorem or honest finite flavor Galerkin run
that emits `W12`, `W23`, and `W13` with row certificates.
