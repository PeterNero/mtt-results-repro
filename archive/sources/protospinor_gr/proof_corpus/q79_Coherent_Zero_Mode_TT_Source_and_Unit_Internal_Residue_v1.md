# q79 Coherent Zero-Mode TT Source and Unit Internal Residue v1

Date: 2026-07-15

## Result

The massless-pole no-go isolated one missing object: the physical TT source
could not live entirely in the positive `lambda=15` channel. It needed an
internal spectral atom at zero. The active q79 Fu-Yau geometry supplies that
atom canonically.

The reconciled branch is

```text
X6_q79 = P_delta x S1_shared,
P_delta -> K3 a principal S1 bundle.
```

K3 and both circles are connected. A fiber bundle with connected base and
connected fiber has connected total space, so `X6_q79` is connected. On a
compact connected Riemannian manifold, the scalar harmonic functions are
exactly the constants. Fixed Points I already constructs the corresponding
joint harmonic projector and states this connected-fiber specialization.

Hence

```text
phi_0 = Vol(X6_q79)^(-1/2),
Pi_0 f = phi_0 <phi_0,f>
       = Vol(X6_q79)^(-1) integral_X f
```

is the unique normalized scalar harmonic projector. There is no fitted value
and no branch sign in `Pi_0`.

## TT source row

Let `E_TT` be the already constructed global helicity-two associated bundle.
Define

```text
i_0:E_TT -> L2(X6_q79) tensor E_TT,
i_0(v)=phi_0 tensor v.
```

Then exactly

```text
i_0^* i_0 = Id_E_TT,
(Delta_X tensor Id_E_TT)i_0 = 0,
i_0^*(E+Delta_X)^(-1)i_0 = E^(-1) Id_E_TT.
```

Therefore the canonical internal massless residue is one:

```text
lim_(E->0) E i_0^*(E+Delta_X)^(-1)i_0 = Id_E_TT.
```

The internal factor is a trivial scalar line; the external `E_TT` factor
carries helicity two and its nontrivial momentum-sphere topology. This avoids
the already proved global line-identification obstruction.

## Relation to the exact lambda=15 result

On the displayed zero-plus-gap carrier the exact operator and resolvent are

```text
A_int = diag(0,0,15,15),
(E+A_int)^(-1)
  = E^(-1) Pi_0 + (E+15)^(-1) Pi_15.
```

Thus the two results complement rather than replace one another:

```text
zero mode: physical massless pole,
lambda=15 d_* mode: finite gapped correction channel.
```

This direct sum is a mathematically consistent carrier. Promotion to physics
still requires one selected Lorentzian action to emit both terms and their
relative couplings.

## Exact normalization boundary

The value one is the normalized internal overlap residue. Equivalently, it is
the full pole residue for a canonically normalized TT field. In the metric
coordinate used by the action, the residue is

```text
kappa_h^(-1) Id_E_TT.
```

Consequently this theorem does not derive `kappa_h`, Newton's constant, or the
stress tensor coupling. It closes the previously missing geometric zero-mode
row, not the selected-action and metrology layers.
