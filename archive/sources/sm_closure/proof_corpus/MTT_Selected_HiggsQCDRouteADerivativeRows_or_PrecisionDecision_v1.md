Status: `MTT_SELECTED_HIGGSQCDROUTEADERIVATIVEROWS_OR_PRECISIONDECISION_BUILT_QCD_FERMIONIC_DERIVATIVES_LOOPS_EW_OPEN`.

This artifact executes the route-A QCD fermionic derivative block for
`H_to_bb`, `H_to_cc`, and `H_to_ss`.

The row formula is the repo's running-mass QCD proxy carrier:

`Gamma(H->qq)=3 G_F M_H m_q(M_H)^2 K_QCD/(4 pi sqrt(2))`.

For each row it records derivatives with respect to `G_F`, `M_H`, the running
quark mass, and a QCD `K_QCD` slot. The alpha_s derivative is currently only an
effective K-slot sensitivity, so this is not promoted to full multiloop
precision.

This closes the QCD fermionic derivative block at proxy tier only. Loop rows,
off-shell rows, full threshold derivatives, precision Higgs closure, true SM
equivalence, and no-knob closure remain open.
