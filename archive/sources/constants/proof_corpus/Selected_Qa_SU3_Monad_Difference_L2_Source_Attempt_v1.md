# Selected Qa/SU3 Monad Difference L2 Source Attempt v1

## Result

The ordered branch source has been sharpened again.  The Iwasawa monad line
table contains the exact ordered integral lift:

```text
L3 = (1,-1,0),
K2 = (0, 1,0),
L3 - K2 = (1,-2,0),
2(L3 - K2) = (2,-4,0).
```

This is stronger than the finite mod-3 qutrit orientation and is not an
equal-radius import.  It gives the right ordered branch clue for the visible
rank-two `V_alpha` extension.

## What Closed

The q79 sufficiency theorem proves:

```text
If MTT supplies Selected_Monad_Difference_L2_Source.v1,
then the ordered-source validator passes.
```

The hypothetical selected packet passes with:

```text
validator exit: 0
status: PASS
open items: none
```

The unselected current candidate is refused with:

```text
validator exit: 2
status: OPEN
packet is marked fixture_only
source.selected_by_mtt is not true
source status is not a selected ordered-source status
standard lattice/base ordering evidence missing
Pic0 resolution missing
```

The promotion from the unselected to the hypothetical selected packet changes
only source-selection and `Pic0` fields.  The arithmetic target and ordered
Chern matrix stay fixed.

## What Did Not Close

The actual source theorem is still open:

```text
actual MTT selection of L3-K2: no
typed monad sections supplied: no
L3-K2 bound to L2 Appell-Humbert/Cech transitions: no
Pic0 selected or quotiented: no
Ext packet promoted and stability proved: no
same-source D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green: no
full SM closure: no
```

Also, the printed monad is not itself the whole visible `c2=4 alpha_1` source.
Its role is an ordered branch/source clue; using it as the full visible source
would violate the role-separation gate.

## Next Object

The next proof object is now exactly:

```text
Selected_Monad_Difference_L2_Source.v1
```

It must prove:

```text
L3-K2 is selected as the visible V_alpha ordered integral source slot,
the standard or equivalent Iwasawa lattice and base order are selected by source data,
neutral Pic0 is selected or Pic0 is quotient-irrelevant,
the monad-difference label binds to the Appell-Humbert/Cech L2 transitions,
typed monad sections or equivalent transition data are supplied.
```

## Gate Verdict

```text
monad-difference L2 source closed: no
sufficiency theorem closed: yes
remaining gate is selected monad-difference source: yes
target fitting used: no
```
