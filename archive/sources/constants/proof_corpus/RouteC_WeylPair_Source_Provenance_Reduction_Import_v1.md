# RouteC WeylPair Source Provenance Reduction Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_WEYLPAIR_SOURCE_PROVENANCE_IMPORTED_CARRIER_CLOSED_SECTOR_CHARGE_OPEN`.

The source-level qutrit Weyl carrier is now closed: the selected S3/GS source
supplies the phase/clock `Z`, the shift/translation `X`, and active shift
`(1,1)`.

```text
phase_Z_residual              = 6.202651996836365e-13
shift_X_residual              = 0.0
projective_commutator_residual = 6.473657049138938e-16
active_shift                  = [[1, 1]]
```

The transfer map is conditionally exact:

```text
T(Z) = sector_route(u,e; I + Z)
T(X) = sector_route(d,nuD; I + X)
phase_residual = 0.0
shift_residual = 0.0
```

This still does not promote the conditional transfer to selected `A_selected`.
The missing object is an independent selected sector-charge/chirality certificate
that derives the route `{u,e}|{d,nuD}` and its normalization without using the
locked target columns as selector.

No observed masses, mixings, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target residuals
are used as selectors.

Next artifact: `Q79_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_SectorCharge_or_Chirality_Certificate_v1`.
