# SameSourceDynamicTransferIdentity or GalerkinC1Contractions Emission Import v1

Status: `SAMESOURCE_DYNAMIC_TRANSFER_IDENTITY_NORMAL_FORM_IMPORTED_OPEN`.

## Normal Form

Selected promotion is now equivalent to proving:

```text
Phi_C1_selected(Z) = phase_packet
Phi_C1_selected(X) = shift_packet
A_selected = [phase_packet, shift_packet]
b_selected = phase_packet + shift_packet
G_selected = A_selected^T A_selected = 12 I_2
```

If this identity is proved in the fixed 72-real coordinate system, then:

```text
A_selected^T b_selected = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

## Falsifier

If selected transfer, selected `b_selected`, or honest Galerkin C1 contractions
emit different values, the conditional Weyl-pair packet remains diagnostic and
the emitted selected equation must be solved instead.

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or lifted
flags are used as selectors.
