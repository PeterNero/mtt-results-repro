# MTT q79 Height-Four Beta-Only Krawczyk Method Floor (A396) v1

A396 evaluates the optimistic monotone limit of the current independent-box point-Krawczyk calculation: all beta uncertainty and the residual center correction are set to zero, while the certified 76-cycle, handle, wall, and A384 point-Jacobian enclosures are retained.

The resulting equivalent coordinate-square radius is `0.000586528433085`, compared with the A385S radius `1e-07`: a gap of `5865.28433085`. The dominant retained period source in L2 radius is `raw_76_thimble_chain`.

This is a no-go result only for beta-only tightening inside the current independent-box sufficient test. It is not a lower bound on the true residual uncertainty and does not exclude a correlation-preserving coupled transport or a covariant zero.
