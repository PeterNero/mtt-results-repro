# B.QFT.02 Local Formal Physical-State Assessment

Date: 2026-07-24

## Verdict

The anomaly-free q79 Standard-Model quantum-BV cohomology now has a proved
nonempty family of formal positive interacting states and formal physical
pre-Hilbert representations on a basis of bounded, causally complete,
\(H^1=0\) local regions.

This changes the named state/positivity clause from open to closed at the
local formal-existence tier.

The executable certificate passes 74 of 74 checks.

## Exact new construction

For one gauge generator and one nonzero spatial mode, the certificate builds
the graded basis

```text
(two transverse, longitudinal, auxiliary, ghost, antighost)
```

and exact matrices \(Q_0,J,h,P_{\rm phys}\) satisfying

\[
Q_0^2=0,\qquad
Q_0^\dagger J=JQ_0,\qquad
Q_0h+hQ_0=I-P_{\rm phys}.
\]

At ghost number zero,

\[
\left.J\right|_{\ker Q_0}
=\operatorname{diag}(1,1,0),
\]

and the unique null direction is BRST exact. The quotient therefore has Gram
matrix \(I_2\).

Repeating over \(8+3+1=12\) gauge generators gives 24 physical transverse
directions per nonzero spatial eigenmode. Positive Higgs Fock and Weyl CAR
Hadamard factors tensor with this quotient. The Weyl factor has rank 48 in
the selected chiral internal bundle and 96 complex local field components
after the rank-two left-Weyl spin factor is included.

## Interacting step

The preceding exact anomaly calculation and all-orders formal QME scheme are
essential inputs. They permit a conserved hermitian local interacting BRST
current and a charge

\[
Q_I=Q_0+\lambda Q_1+\lambda^2Q_2+\cdots,
\qquad
Q_I^2=0.
\]

The Duetsch-Fredenhagen deformation theorem then preserves:

- nonnegative norm on closed ghost-zero vectors;
- null-equals-exactness;
- existence of a formal closed lift for every free physical vector.

Consequently

\[
\ker Q_I/\operatorname{im}Q_I
\]

is a formal pre-Hilbert space and admits normalized formal positive vector
states.

## Why this is not the old conditional claim

No TT-to-full-positivity inference and no Euclidean reflection-positivity
assumption is used. The proof is local, Lorentzian, BRST-cohomological, and
depends directly on the newly closed QME/anomaly tier.

The ghost-extended algebra is still indefinite. Positivity is asserted only
for ghost-number-zero physical cohomology.

## Scope

Closed:

- exact free BRST quartet positivity;
- positive gauge-Higgs-Weyl free tensor state;
- local hermitian nilpotent interacting charge;
- formal deformation-stable physical quotient;
- existence of normalized formal positive interacting states.

Still open:

- a preferred state or vacuum;
- global compatibility and gluing;
- a Hilbert completion at fixed physical couplings;
- selected RG evolution, matching, and uncertainty;
- observable comparison;
- scattering states where required;
- convergence and nonperturbative completion;
- upper-MTT action and vacuum selection.

## Objective significance

This is a real QFT consistency closure, not a numerical prediction. It shows
that the q79-composed anomaly-free local Standard Model is not merely a
formal cohomology with unknown sign: its physical local cohomology has
formal positive representations.

The MTT-specific contribution is the composition with the selected q79
spacetime and already certified field/group carrier. The positivity and
deformation machinery is established BRST/pAQFT mathematics.

No physical parameter, fit, or measured value is added.
