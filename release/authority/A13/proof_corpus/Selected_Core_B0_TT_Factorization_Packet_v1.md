# Selected Core B0 TT Factorization Packet v1

## Canonical Fill

The final packet can now be filled canonically:

```text
B0^*P_TT := U_TT C,
C = I_2
```

where `U_TT` maps `TT_plus, TT_cross` to the exact `Z64` helicity-2 real
character plane:

```text
U_TT(TT_plus)  = |d_*> tensor c_2
U_TT(TT_cross) = |d_*> tensor s_2
```

This is not a numerical fit. `C=I_2` is a TT quotient basis normalization. Any
invertible `C` gives the same support theorem.

## Packet Tests

The verifier checks:

```text
rank(U_TT^* B0^*P_TT)=2
(I-Pi_exact64)B0^*P_TT=0
S_64 B0^*P_TT = B0^*P_TT R_TT(2 theta)
```

All three pass for the canonical fill, with residuals below numerical tolerance.

## What This Closes

This closes the finite packet algebra. If the selected metric shape-map core
`B0` is accepted/sourced as the canonical same-angle equivariant co-shape, then
all downstream implications are already proved:

```text
B^*P_TT = U_TT C'
Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT
support(J_TT)=|d_*> tensor span{c2,s2}
lambda_GR,TT=15
```

## What Still Requires Source Acceptance

The corpus does not yet provide independent entries for the actual metric
shape-map core `B0`. Therefore this packet is a canonical fill, not an
unconditional source computation.

The remaining source statement is now maximally small:

```text
The selected metric shape-map core B0 is the canonical same-angle TT co-shape
on the exact central-circle branch.
```
