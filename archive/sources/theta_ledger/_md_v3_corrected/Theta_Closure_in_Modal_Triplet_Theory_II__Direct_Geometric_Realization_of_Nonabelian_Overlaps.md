  on a compact Heisenberg nilmanifold with left--invariant metric.
  We show that these overlaps can be matched exactly to the numerical
  $\Theta$--targets extracted from Standard Model gauge couplings at the matching
  scale $\mu_\Theta=5~\mathrm{TeV}$, while satisfying all spectral gap and

  Theta Closure in Modal Triplet Theory II:
  Direct Geometric Realization of Nonabelian Overlaps
---

# Relation to the $\Theta$--closure core paper

This paper is a direct continuation of
*Gauge Couplings, Internal Geometry, and $\Theta$--Closure in Modal Triplet Theory*
(Paper I).

Paper I established:

- the extraction of numerical $\Theta$--targets
  $$\frac{I_2}{I_1}\approx 0.560,
  \qquad
  \frac{I_3}{I_1}\approx 0.229$$
  at the matching scale $\mu_\Theta=5~\mathrm{TeV}$,

- the existence of an admissible $\Theta$--region consistent with
  spectral gap constraints.

The present paper performs the missing step:

> *explicit computation of the leading--order overlap integrals*
> $I_2^{(0)}$ and $I_3^{(0)}$ from internal geometry.

No additional physical assumptions are introduced.

# Overlap definitions

We recall the overlap integrals defined in Paper I:
$$I_a = \int_{B_a} \langle \omega_a, \omega_a\rangle\,d\mu_{B_a},
\qquad a=1,2,3,$$
with $B_a \simeq S^1_{\mathrm{cen}}\times\Sigma_a$.

The abelian overlap $I_1$ is fixed exactly by the
$S^1_{\mathrm{cen}}$ normalization:
$$I_1 = 2\pi R_1.$$

We compute $I_2^{(0)}$ and $I_3^{(0)}$ below.

#### Convention

All radii and overlap parameters in this paper are expressed in the same
dimensionless internal unit system used in Paper I.  Thus equations such as
$(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2=0.280\,R_1$ are statements about dimensionless
moduli after the common internal length unit has been factored out.  If physical
length dimensions are restored, the corresponding unit factors must be restored
on both sides.

# Lens sector: computation of $I_2^{(0)}$

## Lens geometry

The MTT Foundation uses a constant--curvature lens layer with spectral bound
$$\lambda_{\mathrm{lens}} \ge \frac{2}{(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2}.$$

#### Remark

The coefficient $2/R^2$ is the exact first nonzero Laplace--Beltrami eigenvalue on the round
two-sphere of radius $R$. Thus modeling the lens layer as a constant-curvature $S^2$ scaled by
the effective radius $f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}}$ is the minimal geometry consistent with the stated
spectral bound.

The coefficient "2" uniquely identifies the round two--sphere
as the baseline effective model.  In this paper the phrase "lens layer" denotes
the effective two-dimensional constant-curvature base used for the overlap
calculation, not the full three-dimensional lens space $L(3,1)$.  A full
$L(3,1)$ realization would require a separate fiber-reduction argument and is
not used in the numerical overlap computation below. We therefore take
$$\Sigma_2 \simeq S^2,
\qquad
g_{\Sigma_2} = (f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2 g_{S^2}.$$

## Lens harmonic

The massless gauge harmonic is taken to be constant on $\Sigma_2$
(after gauge fixing), extended trivially along $S^1_{\mathrm{cen}}$.
Undoing normalization gives
$$I_2^{(0)} = \mathrm{Area}(\Sigma_2) = 4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2.$$

## Matching to $\Theta$--target

From Paper I,
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} \approx 0.560,
\qquad I_1 = 2\pi R_1.$$

Hence
$$\frac{4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2}{2\pi R_1} = 0.560
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2 = 0.280\,R_1.$$

#### Proposition

The lens overlap $I_2^{(0)}$ matches the $\Theta$--target
for $(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2 = 0.280\,R_1$.

## Lens admissibility

The spectral bound gives
$$\lambda_{\mathrm{lens}} \ge \frac{2}{0.280\,R_1}.$$

Since admissibility of the circle sector requires $R_1\le 2$,
we obtain $\lambda_{\mathrm{lens}}\ge 3.57 \gg 0.25$.
Thus the lens sector is safely admissible.

# Nil sector: computation of $I_3^{(0)}$

## Nil geometry

We take $\Sigma_3$ to be the standard compact Heisenberg nilmanifold
$\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ with integer lattice and
left--invariant metric
$$g_{\mathrm{nil}} = a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2 + c^2\sigma_3^2,$$
where
$$\sigma_1=dx,\quad \sigma_2=dy,\quad \sigma_3=dz-x\,dy.$$

## Canonical massless harmonics

The first cohomology is generated by the closed forms $dx$ and $dy$.
We choose the isotropic convention
$$a=b,$$
which renders the overlap independent of the basis in
$\mathrm{span}\{dx,dy\}$.

## Overlap computation

For $\omega^{(0)}=dx$ or $dy$,
$$|\omega^{(0)}|^2 = \frac{1}{a^2},
\qquad
d\mathrm{vol} = a^2 c\,(\sigma_1\wedge\sigma_2\wedge\sigma_3).$$

Hence
$$I_3^{(0)} = \int |\omega^{(0)}|^2\,d\mathrm{vol} = c.$$

## Matching to $\Theta$--target

From Paper I,
$$\frac{I_3}{I_1}\approx 0.229
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
I_3 \approx 1.439\,R_1.$$

Therefore
$$\boxed{c = 1.439\,R_1.}$$

#### Proposition

For the isotropic nil metric $a=b$ with $c=1.439\,R_1$,
the leading--order nil overlap $I_3^{(0)}$ matches the $\Theta$--target.

## Nil admissibility

The scalar Laplacian on $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ has spectrum
$$\lambda_1 \ge \min\left\{\frac{4\pi^2}{a^2},
\;\frac{2\pi}{a^2}+\frac{4\pi^2}{c^2}\right\}.$$

With $a=b=1$ and $c\le 2.878$ (from $R_1\le 2$),
$$\lambda_1 \gtrsim 11 \gg 0.25.$$

Thus the nil sector satisfies the MTT admissibility bound
$\lambda_{\mathrm{nil}}\ge 0.25$ with large margin.

# Conclusion

We have shown that, within the baseline internal geometry of Modal Triplet Theory:

- the lens overlap $I_2^{(0)}$ is fixed uniquely by the
  $\Theta$--target and matches it for a natural constant--curvature lens;

- the nil overlap $I_3^{(0)}$ is computed explicitly on the
  compact Heisenberg nilmanifold and matches the $\Theta$--target
  for a simple isotropic metric choice;

- all spectral gap and admissibility conditions are satisfied.

This completes the direct geometric (Route A) evaluation of
nonabelian overlaps and closes the $\Theta$--loop at leading order
without invoking twistor or string constructions.

# Spectral lower bound on $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ for the left-invariant metric

This appendix justifies the spectral estimate used in the nil admissibility check.

## Heisenberg nilmanifold and left-invariant metric

Let $\mathrm{Nil}_3$ be the Heisenberg group with global coordinates $(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3$
and left-invariant 1-forms
$$\sigma_1 = dx,\qquad
\sigma_2 = dy,\qquad
\sigma_3 = dz - x\,dy,$$
satisfying $d\sigma_1=d\sigma_2=0$ and $d\sigma_3=-\sigma_1\wedge\sigma_2$.

Let $\Gamma$ be the standard integer lattice so $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ is compact.
Equip it with the left-invariant metric
$$g = a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2 + c^2\sigma_3^2,
\qquad a,b,c>0.$$

The dual left-invariant vector fields are
$$X=\partial_x,\qquad
Y=\partial_y + x\,\partial_z,\qquad
Z=\partial_z,$$
with $[X,Y]=Z$ and other brackets zero.
An orthonormal frame is
$$e_1=\frac{1}{a}X,\qquad e_2=\frac{1}{b}Y,\qquad e_3=\frac{1}{c}Z.$$

## Scalar Laplacian

For a left-invariant orthonormal frame, the scalar Laplacian on functions may be written as
$$\Delta f = -(e_1^2+e_2^2+e_3^2)f$$
(up to sign convention; we use the nonnegative operator $-\sum e_i^2$).
Substituting the frame gives
$$\begin{equation}
\Delta
=
-\frac{1}{a^2}\partial_x^2
-\frac{1}{b^2}(\partial_y + x\partial_z)^2
-\frac{1}{c^2}\partial_z^2.
\label{eq:nil_laplacian}
\end{equation}$$

## Fourier decomposition in the central direction

Because $z$ is periodic on $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$, expand
$$f(x,y,z)=\sum_{p\in\mathbb{Z}} e^{2\pi i p z}\,g_p(x,y).$$
On the $p$-th mode, $\partial_z\mapsto 2\pi i p$ and Equation (nil_laplacian) becomes
$$\begin{equation}
\Delta_p
=
-\frac{1}{a^2}\partial_x^2
-\frac{1}{b^2}(\partial_y + 2\pi i p\,x)^2
+\frac{(2\pi p)^2}{c^2}.
\label{eq:nil_laplacian_p}
\end{equation}$$

We bound the lowest nonzero eigenvalue by analyzing $p=0$ and $p\neq 0$ separately.

## The $p=0$ sector (torus bound)

For $p=0$,
$$\Delta_0 = -\frac{1}{a^2}\partial_x^2-\frac{1}{b^2}\partial_y^2$$
on the flat 2-torus $(x,y)\in(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^2$.
Its eigenvalues are
$$\lambda^{(0)}_{m,n} = 4\pi^2\left(\frac{m^2}{a^2}+\frac{n^2}{b^2}\right),
\qquad (m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2.$$
Hence the smallest nonzero eigenvalue in this sector satisfies
$$\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\min}^{(0)} \ge \frac{4\pi^2}{\max(a^2,b^2)}.
\label{eq:lambda_p0}
\end{equation}$$

## The $p\neq 0$ sector (Landau/oscillator lower bound)

For $p\neq 0$, the operator Equation (nil_laplacian_p) is the magnetic Laplacian on a 2-torus
with constant magnetic field proportional to $p$, plus a strictly positive shift $(2\pi p)^2/c^2$.
A conservative lower bound follows by dropping the nonnegative $x$-dependence and using the
lowest Landau-level scale:
$$\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\min}^{(p)} \;\ge\; \frac{2\pi |p|}{ab} + \frac{(2\pi p)^2}{c^2},
\qquad p\neq 0.
\label{eq:lambda_pnonzero}
\end{equation}$$
(For our purposes it suffices to retain the $|p|=1$ bound.)

Under the isotropic convention $a=b$, this yields
$$\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\min}^{(1)} \ge \frac{2\pi}{a^2}+\frac{4\pi^2}{c^2}.
\label{eq:lambda_p1}
\end{equation}$$

## Combined lower bound

Combining Equation (lambda_p0) and Equation (lambda_p1), we obtain
$$\begin{equation}
\lambda_1\big(\Delta_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}\big)
\;\ge\;
\min\left\{
\frac{4\pi^2}{a^2},
\;
\frac{2\pi}{a^2}+\frac{4\pi^2}{c^2}
\right\},
\qquad (a=b).
\label{eq:lambda_min_final}
\end{equation}$$

In particular, for $a=b=1$ and any $c\le 2.878$, one has
$$\lambda_1 \ge 2\pi + \frac{4\pi^2}{c^2}
\ge 2\pi + \frac{4\pi^2}{(2.878)^2}
\approx 6.283 + 4.77 \approx 11.05,$$
which is much larger than the admissibility floor $0.25$ used in Paper I.

#### Remark

The estimates above are intentionally conservative and suffice only to demonstrate a large
spectral margin. A full spectral decomposition of $\Delta$ on the compact nilmanifold is known
in the literature, but is not required for the present admissibility verification.

# Conclusion

In this paper we have carried out a direct geometric (Route A) computation of the
leading--order nonabelian overlap integrals $I_2^{(0)}$ and $I_3^{(0)}$ in Modal
Triplet Theory.

For the $SU(2)$ sector, modeling the lens layer as a constant--curvature
two--sphere uniquely fixes the overlap normalization as
$$I_2^{(0)} = 4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2,$$
which matches the $\Theta$--target derived from Standard Model data for
$$(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2 = 0.280\,R_1.$$

For the $SU(3)$ sector, taking the internal color space to be the compact
Heisenberg nilmanifold $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ with isotropic horizontal
metric yields a canonical leading--order overlap
$$I_3^{(0)} = c,$$
which matches the $\Theta$--target for
$$c = 1.439\,R_1.$$

We verified explicitly that, for these parameter choices, the scalar Laplacian
on $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ has first nonzero eigenvalue far above the
baseline admissibility threshold $\lambda_{\ast}\ge 0.25$, demonstrating that the
nil sector satisfies the MTT spectral gap requirements with large margin.

The constructions presented here establish the existence of explicit admissible
internal geometries realizing $\Theta$--closure at leading order. No claim of
uniqueness or naturalness is made; rather, this work provides a concrete and
computable baseline against which alternative geometries or corrections may be
tested.

Together with the independent twistor--action derivation of Paper III, these
results show that the leading--order nonabelian overlaps are fixed by internal
structure rather than chosen freely, and that $\Theta$--closure of the gauge
sector is robust under independent derivation routes.

#### Remark

The constructions presented in this paper establish the existence of explicit
internal geometries realizing $\Theta$--closure at leading order and demonstrate
rigidity once $\Theta$ is fixed.
No claim is made that these geometries are unique or inevitable.
Determining whether the admissible geometry class is dynamically selected or
whether alternatives are excluded by stability considerations is an open
question and a natural direction for future work.
