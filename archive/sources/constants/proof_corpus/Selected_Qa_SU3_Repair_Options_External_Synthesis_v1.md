# Selected Qa/SU3 Repair Options External Synthesis v1

## Purpose

This artifact explores the three repair branches for the Iwasawa `Qa/SU3`
packet:

```text
ordinary full nil-theta line bundles,
source-certified direct D_E/rho_E operator exit,
projective gerbe / twisted Chan-Paton module.
```

It uses audited local repo results and external mathematical/string-theory
anchors only as container evidence, not as MTT selection data.

## External Anchors

The external literature supports the following split:

```text
Iwasawa geometry:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02180

ordinary torus line-bundle factors:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appell%E2%80%93Humbert_theorem

nil-theta / Heisenberg harmonic analysis:
https://www.ams.org/tran/2010-362-02/S0002-9947-09-04852-1/

B-field / twisted Chan-Paton bundles:

Deligne cohomology and bundle-gerbe D-brane holonomy:

```

## Route Evaluation

### 1. Ordinary full nil-theta line bundles

Status:

```text
conditionally retired unless c is source-amended
```

The other `Qa/SU3` packet repo found the key obstruction.  Under the literal
Iwasawa form reading:

```text
d omega1 = 0
d omega2 = 0
d omega3 = omega1 wedge omega2

a = (i/2) omega1 wedge baromega1 is closed
b = (i/2) omega2 wedge baromega2 is closed
c = (i/2) omega3 wedge baromega3 is not closed
```

Eight of the eleven required section spaces use the `c` direction.  So ordinary
line bundles cannot be the proof source unless the corpus supplies a closed
integral/Bott-Chern representative for `c` and the corresponding factors of
automorphy.

### 2. Direct source-certified operator exit

Status:

```text
live, but no current source exit
```

This would be the fastest rigorous route if the corpus supplied a corrected and
selected `A01`, `D_E`, `rho_E`, Cech, or Dolbeault packet.  Current audits do
not find such an exit.

### 3. Projective gerbe / twisted module

Status:

```text
primary solution candidate, source selection still open
```

This is the first real solution candidate.  Split every charge as:

```text
(a,b,c) = ordinary closed (a,b) line-bundle charge + gerbe c twist.
```

Then every monad product cancels the `c` twist:

```text
c(F_i) + c(G_i) = c(P) = 0
```

for all five products.  The product lands in the untwisted `P` sector.  Thus the
literal nonclosed `c` form is no longer being used as an ordinary first Chern
class.

## Verdict

```text
solution found at typing level: yes
full packet closed: no
best solution candidate: ordinary_ab_line_bundles_plus_c_gerbe_twist_cancellation
ordinary line-bundle route proof source now: no
direct operator exit available now: no
target fitting used: no
```

## Next Artifact

```text
Selected_Qa_SU3_Twisted_Section_Ring_and_Gerbe_Source_Gate_v1
```

It must supply:

```text
selected Z3/finite-Heisenberg gerbe representative or smooth source lift,
ordinary Appell-Humbert-style a,b factors,
twisted F_i and G_i section spaces,
twisted multiplication constants with c cancellation,
Freed-Witten and Green-Schwarz/Bianchi checks,
projector retention,
and D_E/rho_E finite response.
```
