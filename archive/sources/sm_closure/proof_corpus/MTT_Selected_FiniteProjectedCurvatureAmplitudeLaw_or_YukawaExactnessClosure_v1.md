# MTT Selected FiniteProjectedCurvatureAmplitudeLaw or YukawaExactnessClosure v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FINITEPROJECTEDCURVATUREAMPLITUDELAW_LOCKED_SOURCE_FORMULA_EXACTNESS_OPEN`

## What Is Locked

The q79/rank/theta/Higgs finite-reduction law from the previous artifact is now
the locked selected-input amplitude law:

`I = [17.0, 15.0, -21.0]`

`rho = 2.6454590873348714e-05`

It uses no observed masses or Yukawa entries as selectors.

The finite projected `A_N` source exactness theorem and the finite `H` scalar
source theorem are imported as support.  This means finite cutoff approximation
is not the active blocker for selected finite source operations.

## What Is Not Closed

The remaining Yukawa residual is still nonzero:

- max log residual: `3.5578410246936334e-06`
- worst multiplicative Yukawa error: `1.0000035578473538`
- finite replay floor comparison: `4334507.151659151` times the imported
  H scalar replay floor

Therefore the residual cannot be counted as exactness under the currently
accepted finite replay certificate.

## Quarantined Clue

A small-integer diagnostic vector `[27,6,26]` nearly fits the remaining
sector-amplitude residual, but it is not emitted by a selected Yukawa/HYM
operator.  Equivalently, it is not emitted by a selected Yukawa/HYM operator
with a source certificate.  It is retained only as a clue.

## Decision

Closed now:

- q79/rank amplitude law locked,
- finite `A_N` exactness imported as support,
- remaining mismatch localized to one sector-amplitude residual times
  `Q=[-2,3,-1]`.

Still open:

- selected Yukawa finite-projected operator residual source,
- or accepted exactness/error certificate for the ppm residual.
