# V3 Correction Notes

This folder contains corrected Markdown versions of the papers. The original
`_md` folder was not overwritten.

## Main corrections

- Paper I now describes the gauge-sector calculation as extraction of overlap
  targets from measured couplings, not as a first-principles prediction of the
  gauge couplings.
- Paper I corrects the logarithmic running factor to
  `ln(5000 / 91.1876) = 4.00427`.
- Paper II now states the dimensionless internal-unit convention and clarifies
  that the `S^2` lens layer is an effective two-dimensional base, not the full
  three-dimensional lens space `L(3,1)`.
- Paper IV now frames the tensor bound as conditional on the conservative
  identification `Lambda_Theta ~ mu_Theta`, and updates the current CMB bound
  language to the few-times-`10^-2` level.
- Paper V now distinguishes the round-trip weak-angle consistency check from a
  genuinely non-circular prediction.
- Paper V corrects the `Delta r_eff` scan: over `[0.02, 0.05]`, the printed
  one-loop setup gives approximately `0.23157--0.23214`, not
  `0.2312 +/- O(10^-4)`.
- Execution II replaces the non-reproducing CKM and PMNS benchmark matrices
  with printed real matrices that diagonalize to the quoted masses and mixing
  magnitudes up to rounding.
- Execution II now states that CP violation requires a complex holonomy-phase
  extension; it is not established by the printed real matrices.
- Execution II fixes the Higgs quartic matching factor to the standard
  `lambda = (g^2 + g'^2) cos^2(2 beta) / 8` convention and downgrades the Higgs
  mass statement to a corridor requiring a dedicated threshold/two-loop
  calculation.

## Combined file

The regenerated combined manuscript is:

`18 Theta-Closure & Execution Program_v3_corrected.md`

## Remaining rigor work

- Add full citations with scheme labels for all electroweak inputs.
- Replace order-of-magnitude statements with explicit confidence levels and
  pivot scales where observational cosmology is discussed.
- Add executable notebooks or scripts for all numerical benchmarks.
- For CP violation, print the actual complex Yukawa matrices and verify the
  Jarlskog invariant directly.
- For the Higgs sector, run a dedicated two-loop matching calculation before
  claiming a pole-mass prediction.
