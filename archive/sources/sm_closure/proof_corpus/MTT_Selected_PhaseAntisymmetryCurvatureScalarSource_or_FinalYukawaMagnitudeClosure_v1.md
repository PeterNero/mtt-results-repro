## Scalar Candidate

The previous packet used the fitted phase-lane split `c2_u-c2_e`.  This packet
replaces it with the selected-input scalar candidate

`delta_c2 = -((q64+1)/q64) * s_beta`.

With `q64=15` this gives

`delta_c2 = -0.005014489499673223`.

The residual-operator coefficient is

`epsilon_theta * s_beta * delta_c2 = -4.402222824618228e-08`.

This differs from the best-fit residual-operator coefficient by
`-5.934214541811071e-12`.

## Error Certificate

Executing this scalar on the finite residual operator `[27,6,26] outer
Q=[-2,3,-1]` leaves:

- max log residual: `7.959463247076742e-09`
- worst multiplicative Yukawa error:
  `1.0000000079594633`

The declared bound is `8e-09`, and the bound passes.

## Decision

Closed now:

- selected-input scalar candidate for the phase-antisymmetry split,
- no observed-value selector in the new scalar formula,
- accepted ultra-tight bounded-error certificate below `8e-9`.

Still open:

- strict derivation of this scalar from the selected HYM/retarded-overlap
  kernel,
- exact zero-residual Yukawa equality,
- full no-knob SM equivalence.
