# Selected U1 Hypercharge Minimal Source Amendment or Direct Operator Row v1

## Result

```text
direct_operator_row_found = false
source_amendment_currently_sufficient = false
lambda_12_closed = false
target_fitting_used = false
```

The stronger sibling source data help, but they do not yet emit a U1/Y
threshold operator row. The frontier is now a direct operator-source problem,
not a charge/topology/projector problem.

## Minimal Amendment Field Audit

- `U1/Y charge object`: PARTIAL_STRUCTURAL. Missing: same-source declaration that this charge object is the U1/Y threshold bundle/module/local system
- `transition/automorphy/cocycle data and compact domain`: PARTIAL_PROJECTIVE_ONLY. Missing: selected U1/Y transition or twisted cocycle data on the threshold domain, with target-vs-swapped and Pic0 degeneracy broken if the integral lane is used
- `connection or threshold-operator formula`: OPEN. Missing: explicit U1/Y operator row: connection, Laplace/Dirac/BRST/Weitzenbock formula, or D_E/rho_E transition data
- `P_perp compatibility and zero-mode quotient policy`: PARTIAL_INDEX_ONLY. Missing: proof that the emitted U1/Y threshold operator acts on V/<s> and uses this zero-mode quotient policy
- `positive spectrum, multiplicities, hypercharge/index weights`: OPEN. Missing: the actual positive eigenvalue list/table or an exact zeta/heat/torsion replacement emitted before comparison
- `finite determinant prescription and no-target-fit certificate`: OPEN_NO_TARGET_FIT_CERTIFICATE_READY. Missing: selected regularization, scale convention, zero-mode policy, and finite part for this U1/Y row

## Direct Operator Row Tests

```text
projective_s3_gerbe_promotion = PARTIAL_SOURCE_LEVEL_PROMOTION_OPERATOR_ROW_OPEN
twisted_gerbe_fill_attempt = PARTIAL_SOURCE_PACKET_OPERATOR_EXIT_OPEN
visible_rank2_valpha_lane = CONDITIONAL_EXT_MATH_CLOSED_SOURCE_SELECTOR_OPEN
integral_lift_gap = SELECTOR_REQUIRED_NOT_OPERATOR_ROW
```

Strongest current live route:

```text
projective_s3_gerbe_source_plus_selected_visible_Chern_Weil_or_U1Y_operator_row
```

The S3/projective gerbe import retires source-level gerbe, central-cocycle,
Freed-Witten, and projector blockers, but it still lacks the selected
Chern-Weil/operator response, coherent spectral projectors, `D_E`, Riesz/Green,
`dotD`, primitive `C1` contractions, and U1/Y finite determinant row.

## Guardrails

- Do not promote S3 gerbe source-level closure to U1/Y operator-spectrum closure.
- Do not promote conditional V_alpha H1=8 or Appell-Humbert data without source selector and operator row.
- Do not use Delta_Qa=log(2008), lambda_12, sin^2(theta_W), or measured gauge couplings to choose spectra.
- Do not treat P_perp or the 2/3 trace index as a positive determinant spectrum.
