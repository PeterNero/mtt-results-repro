# MTT Selected Step6 MeasuredSMComparisonReadiness or NoKnobValueGap v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_STEP6_MEASUREDSMCOMPARISONREADINESS_OR_NOKNOBVALUEGAP_CLOSED_READINESS_TRUE_EQUIVALENCE_OPEN`.

Step 6 is closed as measured-comparison readiness:

```text
admitted external replay ready        : true
native measured replay ready          : true
dynamic qualitative support ready     : true
no-knob value gap reported            : true
accepted internal scalar rows         : 0
selected universal parameters         : 0
true SM equivalence closed            : false
full no-knob closure                  : false
```

This closes the comparison-readiness layer.  The measured rows are downstream
comparison data only; they do not select source structure, value functionals, or
universal anchors.  The next closure target is the common-RG, covariance/profile,
observable-suite, and selected-SM-packet gate.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_Step7_CommonRGCovarianceObservableSuite_or_FinalTrueSMEquivalenceGate_v1`.
