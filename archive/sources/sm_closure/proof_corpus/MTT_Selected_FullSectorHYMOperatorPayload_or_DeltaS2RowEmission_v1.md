# MTT Selected FullSectorHYMOperatorPayload or DeltaS2RowEmission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FULLSECTORHYMOPERATORPAYLOAD_CONTRACT_BUILT_DELTAS2_ROWS_OPEN`

## Theorem

`FullSectorHYMPayloadReductionAndRhoESupersessionTheorem` is proved.

The newer projective-gerbe packet promotes the q79/F,m=1 projective/twisted
`rhoE` carrier at the selected S3 gerbe source level.  This retires the old
"projective `rhoE` source is open" wording from the `Delta_S2` gate.

It does **not** close `Delta_S2` row emission.  The wall is now sharper:
the selected visible Chern-Weil/full-sector operator payload must emit actual
row-level spectral values.

## Payload Counts

- required payload fields: `10`
- support-present fields: `10`
- selected payload fields: `1`
- blocking payload fields: `9`
- accepted `Delta_S2` source rows: `0`
- accepted `Phi_sector_N` numeric rows: `0`
- accepted strict `c_{s,k}` source rows: `0`

## What Moved

- old `rhoE` source-level blocker retired: `True`
- visible operator source closed: `False`
- diagonal End0 lane closed: `True`
- stationary Riesz/Green transport lane closed: `True`

## Remaining Payload Fields

- `F1_selected_visible_Chern_Weil_operator_source`: visible bundle/sheaf or Route-C source with selected Chern-Weil row and residual
- `F2_HYM_projector_source_promotion`: finite HYM projector values promoted from model-active support to selected source values
- `F3_sector_transfer_rank2_to_rank3`: map diagonal End0 lane into Q,u,d,L,e,N,H sector operator bases
- `F4_full_sector_covariant_D_E_matrices`: full-sector D_E matrices on selected Q,u,d,L,e,N,H bases
- `F5_same_branch_dotD_alpha1_transport_derivative`: dotD_alpha1 including the derivative of the transported U=exp(-u ad(T3)) lane
- `F6_coherent_zero_mode_projectors`: coherent spectral zero-mode projectors retained in the transported sector bases
- `F7_primitive_C1_overlap_contractions`: primitive C1 contractions from the transported D_E/Green/dotD packet
- `F8_End0_to_sector_functor_values`: selected End0 tensor-product or sector-zero-mode realization functor values
- `F9_nonlinear_HYM_offdiagonal_control`: nonlinear HYM correction and offdiagonal End0 control or exact vanish theorem

## Row Bridge

If this full-sector payload closes, the existing `Delta_S2` row-dual density
contract and common-circle trace engine would emit `9` `Delta_S2`, `9`
`Phi_sector_N`, and `9` strict `c_{s,k}` rows.  Current accepted rows remain
`0` because diagnostic residual values are not accepted as source values.
