## Result

```text
dynamic Hessian edge attempted            True
H-sector restriction edge attempted       True
compact H numeric witness retained        support only
conditional Route-B validator             support only
selected HYM rank-2 first solve imported  True
strict M_source gate passes               False
H_response / R_H / M_source emitted       False
Huv / Omega / s_beta / lambda_H           False
```

## What We Learned

The C1/Hessian lineage has exact conditional support:

```text
A^T A = 12 I_2
A^T b = (12, 12)
||b||^2 = 24
deltaTheta_C1 = (1, 1)
```

But this is still not unpatched source emission and it is not a selected Higgs
`H_uv` mass/strain Hessian.

The HYM rank-2/End0 lane is also real progress: it emits the selected diagonal
first solve and the `T1/T2` covariant Green lane.  However the selected
End0-to-sector/H-sector restriction values and projector promotion remain open.

## Rejected Shortcut

The compact H-sector dotD witness contains a numeric offdiagonal value, but it
has `selected_dotD_source_verified=false`, `alpha1_driver_verified=false`, and
`selected_by_mtt=false`.  Hermitianizing it would be an illicit source
promotion and would still target the collapsed single-Higgs carrier, not the UV
two-Higgs `H_u/H_d^dagger` mass/strain block.
