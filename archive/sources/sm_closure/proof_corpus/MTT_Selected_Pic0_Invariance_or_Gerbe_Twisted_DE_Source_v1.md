# MTT Selected Pic0 Invariance or Gerbe-Twisted DE Source v1

## Purpose

This artifact decides how to proceed after the terminal monad lane/Pic0 audit.
It does not assert Pic0 quotienting.  It checks whether a direct Pic0
invariance path is available and, failing that, promotes the finite gerbe route
to the primary executable path.

## Route Decision

- `direct_pic0_invariance`: `RETIRED_FOR_NOW` - No same-source theorem proves that D_E, dotD, Riesz/Green, and overlap observables descend under arbitrary Pic0 twists.
- `neutral_pic0_selection`: `ABSENT` - No holonomy-sensitive source currently selects the neutral flat character.
- `gerbe_twisted_de_source`: `PRIMARY_EXECUTION_ROUTE` - The q79/F m=1 finite gerbe, deck Cech lift, finite S3 Chan-Paton cancellation, and visible Green-Schwarz curvature row are all closed at their levels.

## Cover-Knob Reduction

The good cover is not a new physical knob.  The imported Deligne/Cech reduction
identifies it as an execution scaffold: representatives on different good
covers are related by refinement/coboundary equivalence.  The remaining
physical object is the selected smooth S3 differential-cohomology class and its
restriction/projector/operator data.

## Selected S3 Packet Contract

Schema:

```text
SelectedS3ClassRestrictionProjectorRetention.v1
```

Must supply:

- fixed smooth flat gerbe/differential-cohomology class representing the finite m=1 deck cocycle
- S3 pullback/restriction table with nonzero rank-two image matched to the twisted Chan-Paton module
- W3/spinC or Freed-Witten verification on selected S3 cycles
- block-factorized Q,u,d,L,e,N,H projector retention on the twisted source
- same-branch bridge into selected D_E, dotD_alpha1, Riesz, Green, and C1 primitive contractions

Forbidden shortcuts:

- treating an arbitrary good cover as an MTT-selected physical source
- using the finite projective qutrit module alone as a smooth operator source
- claiming Pic0 quotient without operator/overlap invariance
- using observed masses, CKM, or benchmark matrices to select the source

## Theorem

`Pic0ToGerbeExecutionReduction` is proved as a reduction theorem:

With current corpus data, direct Pic0 invariance is not a legal closure path. The legal primary route is to replace the Pic0 ambiguity by the selected q79/F, m=1 flat torsion gerbe class and prove its S3 restriction, Freed-Witten/projector retention, and same-branch D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green operator source.
