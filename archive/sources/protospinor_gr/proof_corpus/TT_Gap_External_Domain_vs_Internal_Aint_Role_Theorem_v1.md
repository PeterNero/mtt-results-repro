# TT Gap External Domain vs Internal Aint Role Theorem v1

## Result

The selected TT modal gap should not be computed from an arbitrary external box
eigenvalue.

The QG source separates the operator into:

```text
E      = external TT Lichnerowicz block
A_int  = internal incoherent-complement block
[E, A_int] = 0
lambda_* = first positive gap of A_int on the noncoherent slice
```

So the external bounded domain is still required for heat-kernel estimates,
BRST boundary control, and local covariance. But the numerical `lambda_*` in
the SPT damping denominator is sourced as an internal `A_int` gap.

## Consequence

The flat periodic `T3` calculation with `lambda_1=1` remains a useful model
eigenpacket. It does not close the selected modal gap.

The next real numeric gate is:

```text
Selected_Internal_Aint_Complement_Gap_Theorem
```

That theorem must identify the selected GR/QG `A_int` complement from the
fixed-point/projector data and compute its first positive eigenvalue in the
same branch and normalization as the TT response operator.
