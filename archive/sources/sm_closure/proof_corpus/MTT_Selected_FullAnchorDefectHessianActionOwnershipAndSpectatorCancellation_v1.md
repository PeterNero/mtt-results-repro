# MTT Selected Full-Anchor Defect-Hessian Action Ownership and Spectator Cancellation v1

## Lens projector recentering theorem

Let `Q_0` project onto the invariant line `(1,1,1,1)/2` and `Q_1` onto the selected quarter-character
line `(1,i,-1,-i)/2`. Multiplication by the quarter character gives a unitary `U` with

```text
U(I-Q_0)U* = I-Q_1.
```

The numerical residual is `0.000e+00`. Both complements have rank three and forced
normalized trace `3/4`. Their normalized determinants agree for every tested deformation, so A77's
rank-three return block can be recentered on the physical quarter anchor without changing A72/A73.

The A74 unitary-invariant trace also supplies the canonical projective tangent metric:

```text
T_[Q_1] CP^3 ~= Hom(Ran Q_1,Ran(I-Q_1)),
Hess D_Q = I-Q_1.
```

No optional ProtoSpinor isotropy assumption is needed.

## Unique anchor-to-sector functor

The selected center map is fixed by

```text
Phi_anchor(Q_1)=P_e,
Phi_anchor(I)=I.
```

Unitality then forces

```text
Phi_anchor(I-Q_1)=I-P_e.
```

Hence the positive Lens tangent Hessian maps exactly to A80's charged-sector complement defect.
Adding the independently selected colored support gives

```text
delta_e(I-P_e)+delta_q P_colored.
```

The relative sign/anchor-complement routing is therefore closed with no continuous or discrete parameter.

## Spectator audit

Six currently computable spectator classes are ratio-neutral: central identity shifts, the universal A51
tree trace, finite KO6 chirality, uniform fermion parity, the absent independent tree-Higgs column, and a
common internal one-loop spectrum (which is only an RG scale translation). This is not a completeness
theorem: sector-resolved noncentral fluctuation blocks and the A75 rank-two local matching space remain.

## Exact remaining source

The full positive operator is already assembled algebraically:

```text
H_total=(3+delta_e)(I-P_e)+(14/3+delta_q)P_colored
       = [7.69304898011973, 7.69304898011973, 7.69304898011973, 3.0258346667557023, 0.0, 3.0258346667557023].
```

What remains is no longer the sign or the Lens projector. The next artifact is `MTT_Selected_BaselineCostMultiplicitySourceAndNoncentralSpectatorExclusion_v1`. It must derive
the baseline coefficients `3` and `14/3` from the same selected action and either compute or exclude every
sector-resolved noncentral spectator/counterterm. Absolute `P_EW` normalization and independent modern
validation remain downstream. Strict gauge values accepted here: zero.
