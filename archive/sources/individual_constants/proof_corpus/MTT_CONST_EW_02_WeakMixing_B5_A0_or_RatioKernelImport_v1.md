# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B5 A0 or Ratio Kernel Import v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B5_RATIO_EDGE_IMPORTED_HIGH_SCALE_TREE_VALUE_LOW_SCALE_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B5-A0-OR-RATIO-KERNEL-IMPORT`

## Result

B4 proved that internal difference data cannot determine the weak-angle ratio.
That theorem still stands.

The wider corpus supplies a different edge: the Theta overlap ratio

`r_12 = g1(mu_Theta)^2/g2(mu_Theta)^2 = 0.56027`.

This is stronger than difference data.  It gives the high-scale tree identity

`sin^2(theta_W)(mu_Theta) = (3 r_12)/(3 r_12 + 5)`

and evaluates to

`0.2515877565744274`.

## Boundary

This is not a physical low-scale or effective weak-angle prediction.  It still
needs

- `x = g2(mu_Theta)^2`,
- `mu_Theta`,
- `T1`,
- `T2`,
- RG/matching scheme,
- effective-angle profile `kappa_l` if comparing to `sin^2(theta_eff^l)`.

The sibling threshold candidate direct import is explicitly rejected as an
electroweak prediction.  Its useful clue is that the 1-2 split must come from
exceptional/local/representation-sensitive data, not from the symmetric bulk
threshold alone.

## Superset Strategy

We now carry two lanes:

- `A0` lane: find a common inverse-coupling anchor.
- `Theta ratio` lane: use selected ratio data to bypass `A0` at high-scale tree
  level, then derive the physical threshold/RG kernel.

Both lanes forbid measured `sin^2(theta_W)` as a selector.
