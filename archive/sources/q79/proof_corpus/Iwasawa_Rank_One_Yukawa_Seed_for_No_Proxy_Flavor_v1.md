  We extract the first concrete no-proxy Yukawa magnitude seed from the MTT
  flux/string corpus.  The heterotic Iwasawa construction supplies three
  orthonormal harmonic bundle-valued (0,1)-forms, a normalized E6 cubic
  invariant, and a tree-level trilinear superpotential coefficient
  lambda_123=1 after field rephasing.  The same source states that the E6
  27^3 coupling inherits this normalization and gives a rank-one tree-level
  Yukawa matrix.  Combined with the Theta/q79 scaffold, this closes a
  conditional heavy-family seed: one Yukawa eigenvalue is order one before
  entry-wise fitting.  It does not yet derive the light-family masses, CKM
  angle magnitudes, SM representation splitting, or RG/threshold matched top
  mass.

  Iwasawa Rank-One Yukawa Seed for No-Proxy Flavor
---

# Purpose

The Theta/q79 scaffold fixed the environment in which a no-proxy Yukawa
calculation must live:

```text
mu_Theta = 5 TeV,
I2/I1 = 0.560,
I3/I1 = 0.229,
lambda_* = 0.25,
q = 79 mod 448.
```

The next question is whether the corpus contains any actual Yukawa magnitude
that is not chosen as a matrix entry.

It does: the heterotic Iwasawa flux construction contains a normalized
tree-level trilinear coupling.

# Source Statement

In the heterotic flux paper, let:

```text
Psi_i in H^1(X,E), i=1,2,3,
```

be three orthonormal harmonic representatives of bundle-valued `(0,1)`-forms
on the complex Iwasawa background.  The tree-level superpotential coefficient
is:

```text
lambda_123 = integral_X Omega wedge Tr(Psi_1 wedge Psi_2 wedge Psi_3).
```

On the complex-parallelizable Iwasawa threefold, the source states:

```text
Tr(Psi_1 wedge Psi_2 wedge Psi_3) = exp(i theta) bar(Omega),
```

with:

```text
integral_X Omega wedge bar(Omega) = 1.
```

Therefore:

```text
lambda_123 = exp(i theta).
```

A chiral field rephasing removes this phase, giving:

```text
lambda_123 = 1.
```

The same source states that in the `E6` language, the holomorphic cubic
`27^3` coupling inherits this normalization and yields a tree-level Yukawa
matrix of rank one.

# Interpretation

This is not a fitted Yukawa matrix.  It is a normalized trilinear overlap of
selected harmonic representatives.

In minimal matrix language, the rank-one seed can be represented after family
relabeling as:

```text
Y_seed =
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]].
```

The singular values are:

```text
(1, 0, 0).
```

Thus the corpus already supports the following conditional statement:

> If the selected Iwasawa/E6 cubic channel is identified with the SM
> third-family up-type Higgs channel after representation breaking, then the
> tree-level top-family Yukawa seed is fixed to one by normalized geometry.

The word "conditional" matters.  The Iwasawa result closes the normalized
rank-one seed.  It does not by itself prove the SM embedding of that seed.

# Why This Matters

The Standard Model treats Yukawa matrices as free parameters.  Many
compactification frameworks can generate overlaps, but the numerical entries
often remain adjustable through local positions, flux widths, or moduli.

Here the first heavy-family magnitude is not inserted entry by entry.  It
comes from:

```text
orthonormal harmonic representatives,
unit-normalized holomorphic volume,
E6 cubic invariant,
Iwasawa complex-parallelizable form algebra.
```

This is precisely the kind of data that a no-proxy flavor program needs:
geometric normalization first, comparison later.

# Relation to the Existing Benchmark

The corrected flavor benchmark uses a high-scale up-type third-family Yukawa
entry around `0.53`.  That benchmark remains a comparison target, not an input
to the Iwasawa seed.

The difference between a tree seed `1` and a high-scale effective value around
`0.53` can only be judged after:

```text
SM/E6 representation splitting,
Higgs mixing and tan(beta) convention,
canonical kinetic metrics after breaking,
threshold corrections,
RG running from the compactification or Theta scale.
```

Until those are supplied, the correct claim is:

```text
rank-one order-one heavy-family seed closed;
precision top Yukawa matching open.
```

# What Is Closed

The following are closed at seed level:

```text
three harmonic representatives exist in the Iwasawa source,
the cubic overlap is normalized,
lambda_123 = 1 after rephasing,
the tree-level Yukawa texture is rank one,
one heavy-family Yukawa eigenvalue is order one.
```

# What Remains Open

The following are not yet closed:

```text
physical light Higgs/channel selection inside the E6-to-SM dictionary,
which SM family receives the rank-one seed,
canonical kinetic metrics after representation breaking,
light-family lift corrections,
down-sector and charged-lepton textures,
CKM angle magnitudes,
neutrino Dirac and Majorana/Dirac mechanism,
RG and threshold matching.
```

# Next Calculation

The next useful certificate should not tune the first two family entries.  It
should determine the correction sources that lift the rank-one seed:

```text
1. use the formulated E6-to-SM operator dictionary;
2. use the formulated single-Higgs channel projection;
3. compute the kinetic metric for the three harmonic representatives;
4. list admissible higher-derivative, instanton, flux, and non-invariant
   channel corrections;
5. prove which corrections are allowed by q79 and the Theta scaffold;
6. compute the corrected singular values and CKM rotations.
```

# Bottom Line

The full Yukawa problem is not closed.  But the first real magnitude seed is
now visible:

```text
Iwasawa normalized cubic -> lambda_123 = 1 -> rank-one tree Yukawa.
```

That is a serious advance because it gives the no-proxy program a geometric
starting point for the heavy family rather than a fitted matrix entry.
