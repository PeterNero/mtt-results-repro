# MTT Selected PhysicalSourceCertificateFill or RouteBIndependentRunExecution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHYSICALSOURCECERTIFICATEFILL_OR_ROUTEBINDEPENDENTRUNEXECUTION_BUILT_STRICT_VALIDATOR_OPEN`

This step turns the last `Phi_fin^C1` source gate into an executable validator.

Route A can promote only if the same branch supplies physical action restriction,
no extra physical boundary/source term, phase `R_Z`, shift `R_X`, and
`b_selected` emission, with attached source evidence.

Route B can promote only if the 110-row packet is re-executed with selected
basis and quadrature provenance independent of residual-projector replay.

The current attempt intentionally fails the strict validator. That failure is a
result: the repo now has a hard acceptance gate for the actual final fill.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PhysicalSourceCertificateActualFill_or_RouteBIndependentRowsRun_v1`.
