# MTT Selected SourceMapSelectionTheorem or HonestGalerkinC1ValueRun v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_SOURCEMAPSELECTIONTHEOREM_OR_HONESTGALERKINC1VALUERUN_BUILT_SELECTION_TEST_OPEN`.

This gate tests whether the already-built source-map candidate can be promoted.

Closed support:

```text
terminal/static source selection     = closed
R_Z/R_X Weyl-polynomial shapes       = exact
canonical Q_residual                 = unique, rank 6
strict 72-real target                = attached
```

But dynamic selection is still open:

```text
phase R_Z selected now = False
shift R_X selected now = False
b source emitted now   = False
Phi_fin^C1 applies Q   = False
```

If those antecedents are supplied, the numeric replay is exact:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

So the remaining SM-parity dynamic object is sharply one of:

```text
1. selected differentiated Phi_fin^C1 applies Q_residual and emits b_selected
2. honest selected Galerkin C1 value run emits replacement values
```

No observed masses, mixings, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target residuals
are used as selectors.
