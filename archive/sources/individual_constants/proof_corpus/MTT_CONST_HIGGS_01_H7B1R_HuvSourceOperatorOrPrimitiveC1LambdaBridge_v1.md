## Result

```text
same-source functional exit closed               True
direct Huv source exit closed                    False
primitive C1/lambda bridge exit closed           False
current C1 sector order                          u, d, e, nuD
current C1 codomain contains Huv                 False
lambda_12 classified as Higgs lambda_H           False
Huv bridge acceptance contract built             True
B_Huv / M_source / direct Huv emitted            False
s_beta / lambda_H promoted                       False
```

## What Moved Forward

H7B1R tests both legal exits from H7B1Q.  The direct Huv lane remains open, but
now the primitive-C1/lambda shortcut is also classified correctly: current C1
objects live in the `u,d,e,nuD` matter-sector coordinate system, and
`lambda_12=p_Y-p_SU2` is a hypercharge threshold split, not the Higgs quartic.

This is still useful progress because it prevents a wrong promotion.  A future
primitive-C1 route is legal only if it emits an actual bridge with codomain
`Herm(2)` on `(H_u,H_d^dagger)`.

## Remaining Boundary

The next exact gate is:

`CONST-HIGGS-01 / HIGGS-QUARTIC-THRESHOLD / H7B1S-HUV-BRIDGE-FUNCTOR-OR-NONLINEAR-HYM-ROW-EXECUTION`
