# MTT Empirical Equivalence Ledger v1

## Purpose

This artifact records what MTT must match to be at SM-parity with QM, QFT, SM,
GR, and dimensional physics.

It does not compute the actual numerical empirical equivalence yet.  It closes
the audit ledger: what may be measured input, what must be reproduced, what is
forbidden, and what remains open.

## Ledger Rules

- Each empirical comparison must name its accepted reference practice.
- Each comparison must state which measured inputs are admitted and why that is SM-parity rather than no-knob closure.
- Each comparison must identify what MTT must reproduce after admitted inputs are declared.
- Each comparison must list forbidden uses of empirical data.
- No row may use empirical success to select source structure after the fact.
- No row may claim no-knob closure unless the selected internal calculation is present.

## Empirical Domains

### QM measurement and records

- Accepted reference: Standard QM Hilbert/observable/Born/record-update practice.
- MTT parity requirement: Expose state carrier, observable map, and measurement/record rule with declared conventions.
- Measured inputs allowed: experimental records, state-preparation/calibration data
- Must reproduce: Born-probability predictions at parity standard, record/update behavior for compared experiments
- Not allowed: using observed outcome frequencies to select the MTT source
- Status: `INTERFACE_DECLARED_EMPIRICAL_AUDIT_OPEN`
- No-knob target: derive Born weights and record selection from MTT admissibility/coherence

### local QFT observables

- Accepted reference: Local operator/correlator/S-matrix practice with renormalization scheme and scale.
- MTT parity requirement: Declare local observable functor, gauge action, RG scheme, and parameter slots.
- Measured inputs allowed: renormalized couplings, field masses where SM treats them as measured, experimental cross sections for comparison
- Must reproduce: locality/microcausality interface where relevant, correlator or scattering predictions after measured inputs
- Not allowed: fitting thresholds after residuals, treating benchmark correlators as selected operator spectra
- Status: `INTERFACE_DECLARED_EMPIRICAL_AUDIT_OPEN`
- No-knob target: derive local QFT functor and threshold kernels from selected modal/operator data

### SM gauge and representation sector

- Accepted reference: SM gauge group, chiral representations, anomaly cancellation, and three-family structure.
- MTT parity requirement: Declare selected gauge carrier, representation packet, family index, Higgs carrier, and anomaly checks.
- Measured inputs allowed: gauge couplings after packet selection, masses and mixings after representation/basis declaration
- Must reproduce: SU3 x SU2 x U1 sector interface, SM representation content, anomaly consistency, three families
- Not allowed: using couplings or masses to choose the gauge group, family count, or representations
- Status: `INTERFACE_DECLARED_ACTUAL_PACKET_OPEN`
- No-knob target: derive the actual selected SM packet from MTT source data

### Yukawa, CP, and Higgs phenomenology

- Accepted reference: SM uses measured Yukawa matrices, CP phases, Higgs vev/mass/quartic with scheme and scale conventions.
- MTT parity requirement: Admit numerical values only as typed downstream slots after SM packet declaration.
- Measured inputs allowed: Yukawa matrices, CKM/PMNS phases and angles, Higgs potential parameters
- Must reproduce: mass and mixing calculations from admitted slots, basis and phase convention consistency
- Not allowed: benchmark matrices as selected source matrices, target phase fitting as source selection
- Status: `PARITY_INPUT_ALLOWED_NO_KNOB_OPEN`
- No-knob target: derive Yukawa, CP, and Higgs parameters from selected overlap/operator kernels

### GR and stress-energy coupling

- Accepted reference: Metric GR with stress-energy coupling, Bianchi consistency, and measured dimensional anchors.
- MTT parity requirement: Declare metric/effective metric map, curvature, stress-energy interface, and dimensionful anchor slots.
- Measured inputs allowed: Newton scale, cosmological parameters, boundary/initial data at parity standard
- Must reproduce: GR field-equation interface at parity standard, stress-energy conservation/Bianchi consistency
- Not allowed: claiming physical Newton scale from internal dimensionless normalization
- Status: `INTERFACE_DECLARED_EMPIRICAL_AUDIT_OPEN`
- No-knob target: derive metric dynamics and physical absolute normalization from selected source data

### units and dimensionful constants

- Accepted reference: Physics practice separates units, measured dimensional anchors, and dimensionless predictions.
- MTT parity requirement: Declare unit registry, conversion rules, uncertainty propagation, and physical anchor slots.
- Measured inputs allowed: unit conventions, dimensionful measured anchors
- Must reproduce: consistent dimensional analysis, no hidden physical scale in conventions
- Not allowed: using unit choice as a hidden fitted constant
- Status: `PARITY_INPUT_ALLOWED_PHYSICAL_NO_KNOB_OPEN`
- No-knob target: derive physical absolute anchor without measured dimensional input

- `no_knob_constants_derived`: False
- `sm_parity_closure_claimed`: False

## Ledger Theorem

MTT has a complete empirical-equivalence audit interface when every comparison
domain declares accepted reference practice, admitted measured inputs,
reproduction obligations, forbidden empirical shortcuts, and no-knob upgrade
targets.

This artifact builds that ledger.  It does not claim that the actual numerical
checks have been carried out, and it does not claim full SM-parity closure.
