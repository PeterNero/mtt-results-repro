# Higher-Order Flavor Splitting Criterion Import v1

## Result

The higher-order/full-response flavor-splitting criterion is now imported.

The current scalar-permutation C1 layer is proved too symmetric:

```text
Y0 Y0* is scalar identity in every sector.
```

So mass splitting requires a selected correction whose Hermitian contribution
has nonzero traceless part.

## Closed

```text
current scalar-permutation layer no-go: yes
higher-order splitting criterion: yes
full-response acceptance tests: yes
first correction matrix search executed: yes
first Galerkin replay executed: yes
diagnostic splitter found without observed targets: yes
```

## Acceptance Tests

```text
mass splitting:
  traceless part of H_s^(r) is nonzero

CKM/PMNS:
  sector Hermitian corrections are not simultaneously diagonalizable

CP:
  selected complex correction data have a nonzero CP-odd invariant
```

## Not Closed

The diagnostic splitter is not selected MTT data.

Still open:

```text
selected correction matrix source,
selected Galerkin values,
honest replay without lifted flags,
selected dotD source verification,
alpha1 driver verification,
finite C1 Hessian and deltaTheta,
promoted nondegenerate Yukawa hierarchy,
promoted CKM/PMNS/CP,
full SM closure.
```

## Next Gate

```text
Selected_Correction_Matrix_Source_or_Galerkin_Value_Emission_v1
```

It must derive correction matrices from selected Phi_fin/Galerkin emission, not
from a diagnostic search.

## Boundary

No observed masses, CKM, PMNS, CP, or benchmark matrix entries are used or
promoted.
