# Route-C Selected C1 Response Operator Emission Import v1

## Result

The selected C1 response operator is not emitted yet.

The q79 template and extraction attempt provide structure: the alpha1 driver
row, curvature source, response chain, and principal Hessian-symbol support.
But the selected finite data remain null:

```text
finite Hessian blocks
selected source vector
deltaTheta_C1
dotD operators
zero-mode bases
primitive contractions
sector response matrices
```

## Lane Separation

```text
canonical smooth B_N C1 response: computed zero
non-invariant primitive candidates: nonzero but unselected
selected C1 template: correct schema but values-open
```

Thus `A_selected` and `b_selected` are still not available, and the locked
DeltaTheta solve cannot honestly run.

## Status

```text
ROUTEC_SELECTED_C1_RESPONSE_OPERATOR_EMISSION_IMPORTED_A_SELECTED_NOT_EMITTED
```

The next required artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Selected_C1_Operator_Source_or_Galerkin_Rebuild_v1
```
