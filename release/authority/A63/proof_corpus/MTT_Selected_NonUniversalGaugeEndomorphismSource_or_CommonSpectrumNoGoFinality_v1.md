# MTT Selected Non-Universal Gauge Endomorphism Source or Common-Spectrum No-Go Finality v1

## Exact response theorem

On the A46 carrier, gauge invariance forces a finite endomorphism into the gauge commutant,
so it has sector blocks `E_s tensor I_Rs`. With sector order `['Q', 'u', 'd', 'L', 'e', 'N', 'H']` and gauge order
`['U1_GUT', 'SU2', 'SU3']`, the signed matter heat response is

```text
M = [['1/5', '8/5', '2/5', '3/5', '6/5', '0', '1/10'], ['3', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1/6'], ['2', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0']].
```

After projecting to the fixed-scale coordinates `(U1-SU2, SU3-SU2)`, `rank(RM)=2`.
The selected SM carrier can therefore support both independent gauge-ratio directions. This is
an existence/rank theorem, not yet a selected value theorem.

## What is now ruled out

Family splitting alone is insufficient. The three families have identical gauge indices, so a
family operator repeated over complete SM families changes only one scalar coefficient. The full
Weyl response is `[4.0, 4.0, 4.0]` and its relative projection is exactly zero. A62 is thus
final for the common-spectrum/family-only class; the ten closed spectra must not be reopened.

The existing charged `u,d,e` rows give one direction `[3.2, 2.0]` regardless of
whether their positive scalar is provisionally read linearly or through a logarithm. The one-Higgs
block gives the independent direction `[-0.06666666666666665, -0.16666666666666666]`. Together they have rank
`2`, which is the smallest algebraically sufficient support pattern.

## Why this is not yet the prediction

The charged values are typed as Yukawa/threshold rows, not eigenvalues or finite parts of the
gauge-fixed fluctuation Hessian. The H row is available at the adopted one-shared-primitive tier,
not at strict zero-primitive level. No theorem currently places both blocks in one gauge action,
chooses the linear-versus-logarithmic map, and fixes their relative normalization.

For diagnosis only, the measured A52 profile vector can be decomposed exactly in the charged/Higgs
basis with coefficients `[0.5137115691643355, 10.30551667452717]`. Those coefficients are solved from
the measured gauge profile and are not source values or predictions.

## Frontier

The vague request for a "noncentral operator" is replaced by one finite acceptance problem: emit a
same-source gauge Hessian on the A46 carrier with two relative directions, or emit one completely
fixed nonuniversal vector that predicts both ratios. The required fields and guardrails are stored
in `candidate_data/selected_nonuniversalgaugeendomorphismsource_or_commonspectrumnogofinality/next_same_source_gauge_hessian_contract.packet.json`.
