# Corpus Basin-Source Triage

## Question

Does the existing MTT corpus already supply any missing hypothesis of the
Basin-Frame Born Reduction Theorem?

## Result

| Required object | Best existing result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Complex finite carrier | q79 shared line tensored with the two-copy `S3` carrier | exact finite-symbol |
| State/effect algebra | canonical finite-dimensional positive-operator construction | exact after carrier selection |
| Dimensionless unitary | `U(s)=P_Haar+exp(-is)(I-P_Haar)` | exact internal flow |
| Physical time/energy | Foundation separates physical time from compact/internal flow; `kappa_fin` remains open | not sourced |
| Preparation measure | disturbance paper assumes a stationary `mu`; projection paper requires one common selected measure | not sourced |
| Context-indexed basins | contextuality paper supplies the correct architecture conditionally | conditional |
| Capture pushforward | disturbance paper proves `Pr(capture i)=mu(B_i)` under assumptions | conditional theorem |
| Probability noncontextuality | asserted or imported in legacy papers | not sourced |
| Orthogonal coarse-graining | imposed in the old MTT-to-QM theorem | not sourced |
| Preparation-to-density map | absent; old axioms permit depolarized covariant families | not sourced |
| POVM effects | finite detector kernels define normalized POVMs under a supplied response kernel | conditional support |
| Fixed-point response kernel | `B_tau=P exp(-tau A)P` is selected after `(A,P,tau)` are supplied | conditional support |
| q79 coherent restriction | for `A=Q` and `P=P_Haar`, `P exp(-tau Q)P=P`; no outcome atlas or rate is selected | exact no-go for direct use |
| Preparation moment map | `lambda_x -> integral |z><z|d lambda_x` gives `rho_x` and removes ensemble representation dependence after descent | exact conditional functor |
| Capture/effect representation | affine capture has a unique trace-effect form iff it descends through the second-moment quotient | exact conditional theorem |
| Quadratic hazard mechanism | competing clocks with rates `||M_a z||^2` give Born weights exactly | exact sufficient theorem, clock source open |
| Objective outcome law | no selected instrument/trajectory law with sourced probabilities | open |

## Consequence

No overlooked paper closes `B.QM.01` or `B.QM.02`. The available corpus now
composes to the exact implication chain

```text
selected finite q79 carrier
    -> canonical finite operator kinematics
    + upper preparation ensemble                [physical protocol open]
    -> preparation second moment rho            [exact]
    + normalized detector kernels               [conditional support]
    + capture descends through rho               [single physical gate]
    -> unique POVM/effect trace law              [exact finite duality]
    -> pure-state Born formula when applicable.
```

The former noncontextuality and coarse-graining obligations are automatic after
same-effect detector factorization and second-moment descent. The next physical
target is therefore **SecondMomentCaptureDescent**. The most concrete exit is a
selected quadratic-hazard jump law; fixed-point heat smoothing and OU damping
motivate but do not yet derive that law.
