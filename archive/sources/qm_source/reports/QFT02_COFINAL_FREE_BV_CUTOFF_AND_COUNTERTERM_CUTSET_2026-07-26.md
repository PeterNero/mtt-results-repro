# QFT02 Cofinal Free-BV Cutoff and Counterterm Cutset

Date: 2026-07-26

## Decision

The finite-shell work was not the end of the free regulator calculation. The
compact-resolvent theorem canonically assembles all finite shells into nested
spectral projectors converging strongly to the identity.

The free tails satisfy
```text
Green tail:          <= 1/lambda_next
Hodge homotopy tail: <= 1/sqrt(lambda_next).
```
Nested free BV pushforwards compose exactly.

## Hard boundary

This does not extend directly to local interactions. In the exact model
```text
lambda_n=n^2,
d_n=n^3,
```
the covariance norm tail tends to zero but the local diagonal trace is
```text
sum d_n/lambda_n = N(N+1)/2,
```
which diverges.

Therefore raw interacting cutoff removal is excluded. Local counterterms are
mathematically necessary.

## Frontier change

The continuum interacting target already exists as a formal
Epstein-Glaser/QME scheme. The missing object is now one sequence
`Z_Lambda`, satisfying:

1. locality/support;
2. Stueckelberg-Petermann normalization;
3. QME/Ward compatibility;
4. microlocal Cauchy bounds;
5. identification with the EG target;
6. BV-BFV gluing compatibility.

The next pass should construct this sequence, preferably first for a
heat-kernel regulator where locality of the asymptotic counterterms is
available, and then compare it with the sharp spectral projector.

No new physical parameter, selector, fit or observed value was introduced.
