# MTT Selected RThetaValueSource VSD01v2Reconciliation or VSD02Handoff v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_RTHETA_VALUESOURCE_VSD01V2RECONCILIATION_OR_VSD02HANDOFF_RETIRED_VSD01_DYNAMIC_ABSENCE_THRESHOLD_RESPONSE_OPEN`.

This artifact reconciles the current `R_theta` value frontier with the later
VSD-01 v2 packets.

```text
VSD01 source assembly subgate closed           : true
VSD01 dynamic first-response subgate closed    : true
VSD01 same-branch linking closed               : true
VSD01 legacy dynamic absence blocker retired   : true
VSD01 full value obligation closed             : false
```

The old first-row-only rejection path is no longer the active route.  VSD-01
now has source assembly, dynamic first-response tensor, and same-branch linking
recorded.  What remains is not VSD-01 source absence, but the threshold/value
layer:

- `accepted_mass_scheme_conversion_values`
- `accepted_threshold_matching_values`
- `external_threshold_or_likelihood_source_import`
- `multi_loop_threshold_convention_source_rows`
- `no_knob_Yukawa_Higgs_value_source_derivation`
- `true_SM_equivalence_closure`

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_VSD02ThresholdResponseRule_or_ExternalLikelihoodImport_v1`.
