  We isolate the proof obligation for the sevenfold component in the
  effective order-448 MTT flavor CP target.  Corpus searches reveal no existing
  derived Z_7 flavor quotient.  Occurrences of the number seven in beta
  functions, string normalizations, M-theory dimensions, dates, or numerical
  estimates are irrelevant unless they define a finite character quotient.
  A valid Z_7 source must appear as an orbifold/discrete gauge quotient, flux
  congruence, nil monodromy, Wilson-line remnant, or selected stability
  quotient in the Smith-normal-form relation matrix.  This note defines what
  would count as a sevenfold derivation and what would count as numerology.

  Sevenfold Factor Source Criteria for MTT Flavor Holonomy

# Purpose

The clean product target

```text
Z_64 x Z_7
```

requires a sevenfold finite character component.  Unlike `64`, which at least
has a suggestive dyadic relation to refinement and six internal directions,
the `7` factor is not currently structurally identified in the corpus.

This note defines the proof obligation for `Z_7`.

# What does not count

The corpus contains incidental sevens:

- the QCD one-loop coefficient `b_3 = -7`;
- factors such as `(2 pi)^7` in string/M-theory normalizations;
- seven-dimensional internal spaces in M-theory lifts;
- dates and reference metadata;
- numerical bounds containing numbers near seven.

None of these count as a flavor holonomy quotient.

They become relevant only if they induce a finite character relation in the
flavor overlap system.  Otherwise they are numerology.

# What would count

A sevenfold factor counts only if it appears in

```text
Tor coker A_rec
```

or in a selected diagonal character of that finite quotient.

Valid sources include the following.

## Orbifold or discrete gauge quotient

An orbifold action or discrete gauge remnant could impose a row equivalent to

```text
7 e = 0.
```

This would be a direct `Z_7` source.

## Flux congruence

Flux quantization could impose a congruence such as

```text
q · e = 0 mod 7,
```

or a Smith-normal-form invariant factor divisible by `7`.

The existing Lens x Nil flux integers `(f,h)` and Iwasawa flux choices are
legitimate places to look, but no sevenfold congruence has yet been extracted.

## Nil lattice or monodromy

A nil lattice automorphism or monodromy quotient could have order seven.  This
would be valid if the order-seven action preserves the coherent projector and
the flavor overlap bundle data.

## Wilson-line remnant

A continuous Wilson-line phase can be reduced to seven allowed phases by a
global quotient or projection:

```text
theta ~ theta + 2pi/7.
```

This must be derived from geometry or admissibility, not imposed.

## Stability or extremality selection

A global coherence/stability functional could in principle select a sevenfold
finite set of admissible holonomy phases.  This remains conjectural until the
functional and its minimizers are computed.

# Interaction with the dyadic component

The sevenfold factor does not need to appear alone.  It may appear as part of a
larger factor, e.g.

```text
Z_14, Z_28, Z_56, Z_112, ...
```

provided the selected diagonal character has effective denominator `7` relative
to the dyadic component.

The product scan showed that several products with a `64` component and a
seven-bearing component reproduce the CP benchmark.  Thus the real requirement
is:

```text
the finite quotient must contain a seven-denominator contribution
to the selected CP character.
```

# Failure criterion

The sevenfold target fails if the only appearances of `7` are beta-function
coefficients, normalization constants, dimensions, or numerical coincidences.

It also fails if a `Z_7` factor appears in a sector that cannot couple to the
pairwise flavor overlap characters.

# Success criterion

The sevenfold target succeeds if:

1. a derived row or quotient contributes an invariant factor divisible by `7`;
2. that factor survives coherent projection;
3. the selected pairwise CP character uses the seven-denominator component;
4. the phase-sum rule remains exact;
5. no independent phase fitting is introduced.

# Bottom line

The sevenfold side is the sharpest open part of the current CP quotient
program.  The next proof must produce a genuine sevenfold flavor quotient from
orbifold, flux, nil monodromy, Wilson-line, or stability-selection data.

Until then, `Z_7` remains a target factor, not an MTT result.
