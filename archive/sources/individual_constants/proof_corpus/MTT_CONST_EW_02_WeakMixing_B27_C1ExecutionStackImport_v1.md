# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B27 C1 Execution Stack Import v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B27_C1_EXECUTION_STACK_IMPORTED_SOURCE_PROMOTION_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B27-EXECUTE-GAUGEKINETIC-OR-C1-EDGE`

## Imported Progress

```text
primitive C1 algebraic values filled = 72
hessian/source values filled         = 2
sector response values filled        = 36
total algebraic C1 values filled     = 110
finite trace boundary closed         = True
last source contract built           = True
```

This retires primitive-C1 value-slot bookkeeping as the active blocker for the
weak-mixing C1 edge. It does not promote those algebraic values as physical
source values.

## Still Open

```text
same-branch Phi_fin^C1 source emission
same-source b_selected emission
phase R_Z and shift R_X source selection
no extra physical boundary/source term
or independent Galerkin/row-provenance run
K_phys/f_ab, mu_match, and RG/threshold scheme on the gauge-kinetic edge
```
