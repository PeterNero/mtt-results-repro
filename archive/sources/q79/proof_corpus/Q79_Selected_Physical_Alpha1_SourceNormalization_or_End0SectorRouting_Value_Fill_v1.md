# Q79 Selected Physical Alpha1 Source-Normalization or End0-Sector Routing Value Fill v1

## Result

The physical `alpha1` value fill has been attempted on both legal routes.
It does not close selected `dotD_alpha1` replay yet.

The Source-Normalization No-Go is now sharp:

```text
dotD_alpha1 := dotD[h_ext] by notation or normalization choice alone
```

This is rejected because continuous Ext-density scaling does not vary the
integral Chern/source row `c2(V_alpha)=4 alpha1`.  The shared circle stays in the degree-zero lane, so it cannot secretly supply the missing integral source.

The End0-to-sector functor route remains the primary route.  It has compatible
support values, but the values are not promoted.

## Route A: Source-Normalization No-Go

- topological support present: `True`
- central shared circle retained: `True`
- closed as no-go: `True`
- selected source-strength coordinate absent: `True`

Reason:

```text
The selected Ext-density scale is a continuous representative and metric-source tangent inside a fixed rank-two extension class.  The alpha1 row supported by c2(V_alpha)=4 alpha1 is discrete integral Chern/source data.  Continuous scaling of the Ext representative does not vary the integral Chern/source row.
```

What would reopen it:

```text
A same-branch MTT source theorem interpreting alpha1 as a selected source-strength coordinate in the fixed topological class, with a Chern-Weil or retarded-kernel normalization independent of observed data.
```

## Route B: End0-To-Sector Routing Reduction

- End0 row response available: `True`
- selected End0 direction support: `T3`
- same-basis dotD matrices exist: `True`
- conditional Weyl transfer exact: `True`
- SU5/E6 structural partition available: `True`
- honest B_N validator fails only by source flags: `True`
- selected End0-to-sector routing values extracted: `False`
- selected transfer normalization closed: `False`
- values promoted: `False`

Why not closed:

```text
The End0 row response, same-basis dotD matrices, clean sector projectors, and conditional Weyl/SU5 transfer have compatible shape.  They still do not emit a selected R_sector functor or normalization.  The current B_N dotD matrices remain rejected as honest physical values because selected_dotD_source_verified and alpha1_driver_verified are not theorem-derived.
```

The next object must emit:

- domain basis map from selected End0(V_alpha) T1,T2,T3 to sector carrier basis
- sector projectors Q,u,d,L,e,N,H in that selected End0 image
- normalization mapping dotD[h_ext] to each sector dotD_alpha1 matrix
- proof that Z/X or SU5/E6 routing is selected independently of locked target columns
- sector charge/routing table including the 1_M Dirac-neutrino rule or a replacement rule
- same locked q79/F,m=1 B_N basis proof for the Riesz/Duhamel response
- honest validator replay with selected_dotD_source_verified and alpha1_driver_verified true by theorem

Acceptance tests:

- route functor is selected from MTT source data, not from locked target columns
- transfer normalization is fixed before comparison with data
- dotD matrices match sector by sector on the locked B_N basis
- Riesz/Duhamel horizontal response uses P dotPsi_i=0
- diagnostic lifted flags are absent from the honest replay

Forbidden shortcuts:

- using observed masses, CKM angles, thresholds, or benchmark Yukawa matrices
- choosing routing from the desired q79 target columns
- setting a universal scalar to fit dotD norms
- promoting support-level End0 or projector values without a selected functor theorem

Validator flags that must be theorem-derived:

- selected_dotD_source_verified
- alpha1_driver_verified
- selected_End0_to_sector_routing_verified
- selected_transfer_normalization_verified

## Theorem

`Q79PhysicalAlpha1SourceNormalizationOrEnd0SectorRoutingValueFillAttemptTheorem` is proved as a no-go plus reduction theorem.

On the locked q79/F,m=1 branch, the direct identification of the selected Ext-density scale tangent with the physical alpha1 source-normalization is rejected: continuous scaling inside a fixed rank-two extension class does not vary the integral Chern/source row c2(V_alpha)=4 alpha1, and the shared circle remains degree-zero.  The remaining legal value route is the selected End0-to-sector functor/source/value packet.  Existing finite B_N dotD/projector values and the conditional Weyl/SU5 route are support only until that functor, sector routing, and transfer normalization are theorem-derived.
