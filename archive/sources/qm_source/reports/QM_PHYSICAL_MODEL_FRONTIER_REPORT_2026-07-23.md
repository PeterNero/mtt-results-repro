# QM Physical Model Frontier Report

## Why this target was selected

The current P0/P1 dependency graph was ranked by downstream fan-out, active
ownership and whether a short exact proof could move a controlling row.

- `B.ETA9.01` has the largest fan-out, but it is owned by an active worker.
- `B.QM.01` now has exact one-primitive actualization and one-axiom Born
  fallbacks; its zero-primitive source remains a broader action problem.
- `B.QM.02` was unowned and directly gates `B.QFT.01`, while `B.GR.01` is now
  closed.

`B.QM.02` was therefore the highest-value nonconflicting target.

## New result

The q79 Lorentzian coframe closure was hash-pinned and composed with the exact
finite carrier. This gives:

```text
selected Cauchy geometry
  + selected q79 finite carrier
  -> H_Sigma = L2(Sigma,dmu_h;F_q79)
  -> normal state cone
  -> decomposable finite-local observable algebra
  -> global P_Haar/Q projectors and dimensionless flow
  -> exact gauge comparison functor.
```

The construction is global on the Cauchy support, basis-free and exact up to
the already declared diffeomorphism, local Lorentz and q79 carrier gauge. It
adds zero parameters and uses zero observed values.

This is new relative to the earlier finite-kinematics packet, which stopped at
one fiber or flat local trivialization. The enabling input is the later closed
`A_QG + A_causal` Lorentzian coframe result.

## Exact remaining cutset

An exact two-cell witness proves that the same kinematic data admit distinct
self-adjoint generators:

```text
H0 = I2 tensor Q
H1 = I2 tensor Q + [[1,-1],[-1,1]] tensor I6,
rank(H0,H1) = (8,10).
```

The normalized Hessian also permits every physical rate multiple `omega Q`.
Consequently the selected geometry fixes the Hilbert system and internal
operator shape, but not a physical propagator or spatial kinetic law.

The gauge comparison functor is not a laboratory comparison functor. The
preparation-to-state and setting-to-effect/instrument maps remain source data.

## Product-triple audit

The existing A52 product triple cannot fill this gap. Its own theorem says
that the four-dimensional spin triple and Wick dictionary are imported at the
profile standard. Reusing it here would turn an imported SM representation
into a false MTT source theorem.

## Current status

Closed exactly for `B.QM.02`:

- global Cauchy finite-symbol Hilbert space;
- kinematic normal state cone;
- decomposable finite-local observable algebra;
- global normalized q79 projector flow;
- gauge-groupoid comparison functor with zero error.

Closed conditionally:

- global q79 dephasing dynamics after the existing additive one-anchor clock
  lift.

Open:

- strict source selection of physical time/action normalization;
- selected inter-slice and spatial dynamics;
- laboratory preparation and detector comparison maps;
- the full nonzero-Chern continuum HYM state space, if that stronger scope is
  required.

The controlling blocker remains open. Its next artifact is now one compact
same-source payload:

```text
SelectedCauchyDynamicsAndLaboratoryComparison.v1
```

It must emit the generator and domain, clock map, propagator, preparation map,
effect/instrument map and exactness/error certificate from one selected action
and apparatus interface.

## Downstream value

Closing that payload would finish the physical-model bridge at the declared
finite-symbol tier and remove the direct `B.QM.02` dependency from local QFT.
It would not by itself prove local QFT: field locality, causal commutators,
renormalization and continuum mode content would remain under `B.QFT.01`.
