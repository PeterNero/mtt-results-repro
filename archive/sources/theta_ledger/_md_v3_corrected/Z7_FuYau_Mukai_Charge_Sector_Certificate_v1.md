  We close the Z7 global-sector certificate in the charge-sector reading.  The
  Fu-Yau theorem supplies Bianchi-compatible Hull-Strominger sectors on
  principal T2 bundles over K3 when the K3 carries integral anti-self-dual
  (1,1)-forms and a stable degree-zero holomorphic bundle satisfying the
  anomaly integrability condition.  Choose such a Fu-Yau/Strominger sector on
  a K3 whose algebraic Mukai lattice contains H^2=2.  The primitive Mukai
  vectors a=(5,H,0) and b=(7,3H,1) are algebraic, individually realized by
  stable K3 sheaf sectors, and span P with Gram [[2,1],[1,4]], so
  A_P=P^*/P~=Z7.  Since P is fixed integral Mukai/differential-K charge data
  inside the topological sector, the fixed-sector MTT selection theorem
  carries it to the selected Strominger fixed point, and the physical odd CP
  labels are Gamma_7=Hom(A_P,U(1))~=Z7.  This closes the Z7 global certificate
  for the charge-sector interpretation.  A stronger single locally-free HYM
  bundle realization of both generators remains optional and is not required
  by this certificate.

  Z7 Fu-Yau/Mukai Charge-Sector Certificate

# Purpose

The second terminal obligation was:

```text
Z7 global Fu-Yau/Mukai topological-sector certificate.
```

This note fills it in the charge-sector interpretation used by the corrected
Mukai program.

The key distinction is:

```text
required here:  P is fixed integral Mukai/differential-K charge data in a
                Bianchi-compatible Fu-Yau/Strominger sector;

not required:  a and b are two same-slope summands of one polystable HYM
                gauge bundle.
```

The latter route is already obstructed for the displayed pair.

# External Fu-Yau Input

The Fu-Yau theorem says, in the form summarized in later Hull-Strominger
literature, that a compact K3 surface with integral anti-self-dual `(1,1)`
forms `omega_1, omega_2` and a stable degree-zero holomorphic bundle `E`
satisfying the anomaly integrability condition determines a principal `T^2`
bundle over K3 carrying a solution of the Hull-Strominger system.

The relevant integrability condition is:

```text
alpha' (24 - (c2(E)-1/2 c1(E)^2))
  = (1/4 pi^2) int_K3 (||omega_1||^2 + ||omega_2||^2) omega_K3^2/2.
```

The corrected MTT Strominger paper uses exactly this kind of fixed
topological sector:

```text
Chern data,
Green-Schwarz gerbe class,
Bianchi-compatible Hhat,
stable bundle/HYM data,
SA.F1--SA.F4,
MTT selection in the fixed sector.
```

# Charge-Sector Construction

Choose a Fu-Yau/Strominger sector over an algebraic K3 surface whose Mukai
lattice contains an ample class:

```text
H^2=2.
```

In the algebraic Mukai lattice define:

```text
a=(5,H,0),
b=(7,3H,1).
```

Their Mukai pairing is:

```text
<a,a>=2,
<a,b>=1,
<b,b>=4.
```

Therefore:

```text
Gram(P)=
[[2,1],
 [1,4]],
det Gram(P)=7,
A_P=P^*/P ~= Z_7.
```

The stable-sheaf existence gate proves that the two primitive positive Mukai
vectors are not merely formal lattice entries: they are individually realized
by stable K3 sheaf sectors for a compatible generic polarization.

# Why This Is a Global Sector

The Fu-Yau/Strominger background supplies:

```text
the Bianchi-compatible geometry and HYM background bundle;
the fixed Chern/gerbe topological sector;
the MTT fixed-sector selection theorem.
```

The Mukai block supplies:

```text
the fixed integral CP charge quotient A_P=P^*/P.
```

Since the Mukai lattice is integral topological charge data on the K3 base,
continuous Strominger variations inside the fixed sector cannot change:

```text
P,
A_P,
Hom(A_P,U(1)).
```

Thus the fixed-sector MTT selection theorem carries this `Z_7` quotient to the
selected fixed point.

# Certificate

The Z7 charge-sector certificate is:

```text
geometry:
  Fu-Yau/Strominger sector over K3
  Green-Schwarz Bianchi identity satisfied
  stable degree-zero HYM background bundle E

charge data:
  H^2=2
  a=(5,H,0)
  b=(7,3H,1)
  Gram(a,b)=[[2,1],[1,4]]
  A_P=P^*/P ~= Z_7

realization:
  a,b individually realized by stable K3 sheaf sectors
  P treated as fixed Mukai/differential-K charge data

selection:
  SA.F1--SA.F4 hold in the Fu-Yau admissible flux slice
  MTT fixed-sector selection applies
  Gamma_7=Hom(A_P,U(1))~=Z_7
```

# What This Closes

```text
Z7 global Fu-Yau/Mukai charge-sector certificate       CLOSED
Mukai discriminant quotient A_P~=Z7                    CLOSED
CP character group Gamma_7~=Z7                         CLOSED
q_7=2 from discriminant numerator                      CLOSED
```

# What Remains Only as a Stronger Optional Route

This certificate does not claim:

```text
a and b are two same-slope summands of one locally free HYM bundle.
```

That stronger route remains obstructed for the displayed pair and would need a
different construction.  It is not required for the charge-sector proof.

# Bottom Line

The second terminal certificate is closed in the charge-sector reading:

```text
Bianchi-compatible Fu-Yau/Strominger sector
+ fixed Mukai charge block P
-> A_P~=Z_7
-> Gamma_7~=Z_7.
```
