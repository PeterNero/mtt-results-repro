# RouteC Strominger Galerkin FirstRun Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_STROMINGER_GALERKIN_FIRST_RUN_IMPORTED_SELECTOR_OPEN`.

The selected Route-C/Strominger Galerkin first-run manifest is filled.  This is
substantial: all declared finite files exist, the downstream finite algebra can
be tested, and the formal-lift diagnostic passes the lower validators.

It is not proof promotion.  The honest root payload still has selected-source
flags false, and the formal lift is diagnostic only.  The missing object is now
sharp: MTT must derive the selected HYM/Strominger source and a quotient-valid
Galerkin basis, then rerun the same manifest without lifted flags.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RouteC_Source_Selector_and_Basis_Theorem_v1`.
