## Intermediate Flavor Certificates

These are not terminal mass-spectrum certificates, but they record closed
sub-layers of the no-proxy flavor program:

```text
iwasawa_rank_one_yukawa_seed_certificate.json
  normalized E6 27^3 rank-one tree seed.

rank_one_lift_correction_channel_ledger_certificate.json
  finite correction-channel ledger; coefficients still open.

e6_to_sm_yukawa_operator_dictionary_certificate.json
  standard E6 -> SO(10) -> SU(5) -> SM Yukawa operator dictionary formulated;
  physical Higgs selection still open.

single_higgs_channel_projection_certificate.json
  low-energy SM projection H_u -> H and H_d -> H^dagger formulated; high-scale
  color-triplet decoupling still open.

finite_channel_sets_certificate.json
  Gamma_u,d,e,nuD finite channel support formulated; weights still open and
  q79 restrictions supplied by the follow-up certificate.

q79_channel_restriction_certificate.json
  C6 channels restricted to q79/conjugate labels and non-C6 channels restricted
  to the trivial character; weights and orientations still open.

selected_channel_weight_extraction_protocol_certificate.json
  finite A_gamma exp(-S_gamma) chi_gamma extraction rule formulated; benchmark
  entries and observed flavor data forbidden as coefficient sources; numerical
  values still open.

forced_channel_weight_blocks_certificate.json
  first forced values closed: C0 has A=1, S=0, chi=1 and representative E33;
  pure C6 holonomy has S=0 and q79/conjugate unit character. Nontrivial
  amplitudes, orientations, metrics, and matching remain open.

c3_lens_nil_weight_source_audit_certificate.json
  C3 finite support and trivial q79 character retained, but the old Lens-Nil
  coefficient source is retired until the nonclosed beta-form and flux-square
  defects are repaired.

c1_curvature_weight_source_audit_certificate.json
  C1 finite support and trivial q79 character retained; the selected torsional
  curvature source is admissible, but O_C1, corrected zero modes, and numerical
  A_gamma/S_gamma values remain open.

c1_curvature_insertion_formula_certificate.json
  O_C1 is formulated as the linear response of the selected raw Yukawa overlap
  under the selected R_+ alpha-prime curvature deformation. Numerical values,
  Hessian blocks, dotD operators, and zero-mode responses remain open.

c1_iwasawa_rplus_support_certificate.json
  In the selected invariant Iwasawa branch, Tr_grav R_+^2 has alpha_1 support
  only, with coefficient 8 r3^2/(r1^2 r2^2). C1 overlap values remain open.

c1_alpha1_rank_lift_criterion_certificate.json
  For a selected alpha_1 response matrix M, det(E33+epsilon M) has leading
  term epsilon^2*(M11*M22-M12*M21). This closes the algebraic C1 rank-lift
  success test while leaving the actual response entries open.

selected_c1_response_extraction_attempt_certificate.json
  attempts to compute the C1 alpha_1 response matrix. It confirms the closed
  Iwasawa driver row Tr_grav R_+^2=v1_tilde alpha_1 and records the
  operator-level Xi/Hessian source data, but blocks the numerical response
  because finite source vectors, lower-order Hessian inverse, dotD operators,
  and zero-mode contractions are not yet supplied.

c1_finite_response_matrix_reduction_certificate.json
  closes the finite assembly formula for M_u,d,e,nuD from six primitive 3x3
  contraction blocks per sector: direct Theta variation, left/right/Higgs
  zero-mode responses, explicit vertex, and basis transport. Values remain
  open until those primitive contractions are selected.

selected_c1_response_data_certificate.template.json
  future fill-in slot for the actual C1 response data: operator variations,
  zero modes, response matrices M_u,d,e,nuD, rank-lift minors, and CKM
  leading-orientation test.

selected_c1_primitive_contractions.template.json
  future fill-in slot consumed by scripts/compute_c1_response_matrices.py.
  Every null must be replaced by a selected 3x3 primitive contraction before
  the finite C1 matrices can be computed.

ckm_leading_noncommutation_criterion_certificate.json
  Near the shared rank-one seed, leading up/down noncommutation is controlled
  by Delta_v=(M_d13-M_u13,M_d23-M_u23). CKM angles and the selected Jarlskog
  invariant remain open.

jarlskog_closure_criterion_certificate.json
  Once canonical selected Y_u,Y_d are computed, the full matrix-level CKM CP
  test is Im det([Y_uY_u^dagger,Y_dY_d^dagger]) != 0 with nondegenerate
  spectra. The matrices and value remain open.

rank_one_lift_operator_attempt_certificate.json
  rank/CP/representation/Higgs/channel-support/q79-support/weight-protocol
  forced C0/C6 block, C1 admissibility, C1 insertion-formula, and C1 Iwasawa
  Rplus support, C1 alpha1 rank-criterion, and CKM leading noncommutation
  criterion, and Jarlskog closure-criterion gates pass; nontrivial numerical
  values, metrics, and RG matching still open.

full_sm_closure_attempt_certificate.json
  records the current rigorous global status: the q79 branch supports a
  coherent structural SM route, but full SM closure is blocked by missing
  no-proxy selected Yukawa/neutral matrices, kinetic metrics, Higgs boundary
  data, and RG/threshold matching. It explicitly forbids claiming full closure
  from benchmarks, observed masses/mixings, or retired C3 Lens-Nil weights.

selected_full_sm_data_theorem_attempt_certificate.json
  records the direct attempt to prove the Selected Full SM Data Theorem. The
  attempt does not compute actual matrices; instead it proves the current
  certificates are underdetermined by giving inequivalent rank-lift and CKM
  orientation completions that satisfy the closed criteria. The next required
  input is a selected overlap-kernel and metric-data certificate.

shared_knob_cross_encoding_ledger_certificate.json
  records selected MTT/MMT data that several theory encodings read in different
  ways: q79, Z64, Z7, Theta ratios/gap, the Iwasawa rank-one seed, the
  single-Higgs projection, channel weights, C1 alpha1 support, and finite C1
  response assembly. It closes the cross-encoding dictionary, not new numerical
  SM predictions.

matrix_construction_routes_certificate.json
  records six no-proxy routes for creating the missing matrices: algebraic
  cohomology/cup/Yoneda products, physical harmonic normalization, modular and
  topological selection textures, Iwasawa invariant Galerkin contractions,
  spectral Green-operator C1 response, and independent dual triangulation. It
  identifies the next artifact as a selected zero-mode basis and dotD
  certificate; numerical matrix entries remain open.

selected_zero_mode_basis_dotd_interface_certificate.json
  records the input contract for that next artifact. It maps the sectors to
  Q,u,d,L,e,N,H zero-mode slots, requires D_a, Psi_a,i, L2 metrics, P_a,
  G_a, complement gaps, dotD_a along the selected C1 alpha_1 deformation, and
  horizontal-gauge verification, then points to the primitive-contraction
  template consumed by scripts/compute_c1_response_matrices.py. Slot values
  remain open.

iwasawa_galerkin_zero_mode_slot_attempt_certificate.json
  records the first attempted fill of the zero-mode/dotD interface using the
  currently closed left-invariant Iwasawa data. The attempt reproduces only
  the rank-one E33 seed, with C33=0 and no universal up/down orientation
  mismatch. It blocks a completed fill until E6-to-SM cohomology projection
  maps, slot operators, dotD operators, projector/Green data, and the Higgs
  internal representative are supplied.

iwasawa_dolbeault_complex_extraction_certificate.json
  tests the printed finite left-invariant Iwasawa Dolbeault operator
  barpartial_E=barpartial+A^(0,1). The literal A^(0,1) fails integrability
  because (barpartial A + A wedge A)_12 is nonzero. A diagnostic one-index
  repair is integrable but has invariant h1=2, so it is not a selected
  three-family fill. Corrected A01 data or the full monad maps f,g are still
  required.

iwasawa_monad_map_data_gate_certificate.json
  records the remaining monad-route input contract. The source Chern labels
  support c1(E)=0, c2(E)=0, and int c3(E)=6, but scalar constant monad entries
  are not globally typed for the listed Hom line bundles. Explicit typed
  sections f_i, g_i, transition data, g o f = 0, exactness/local-freeness, and
  H^1(X,E) representatives are required before slot projections and C1
  primitive response blocks can be computed.

corrected_a01_candidate_scan_certificate.json
  records a finite sparse search for corrected invariant A^(0,1) matrices.
  Integrable h1=3 candidates exist in the three-entry signed ansatz, but none
  is a one-entry repair of the printed matrix and all h1=3 candidates avoid the
  torsion form e3. The scan therefore blocks silent typo repair and leaves the
  corrected-source-A01 or typed-monad-map routes as the rigorous next inputs.

index_to_three_family_upgrade_gate_certificate.json
  records the distinction between the topological index/net chirality statement
  and the stronger construction of three H^1(X,E) representatives. The c3=6
  data support a net three-family target, but the selected zero-mode basis
  still requires anti-family middle-cohomology vanishing and explicit
  representatives from the corrected Dolbeault or monad complex.

invariant_mc_torsion_branch_gate_certificate.json
  records the invariant Maurer-Cartan equations for A=A1 e1+A2 e2+A3 e3 and
  exhausts the three-entry signed candidates with e3 support. The canonical
  Heisenberg torsion branch is integrable but has cohomology (1,2,2,1), and
  every integrable torsion-support candidate in the ansatz has h1=2. Thus h1=3
  requires a stronger selected A01, typed monad maps, or non-invariant modes.

iwasawa_invariant_a01_repair_obstruction_certificate.json
  retires invariant A01 repair as a current proof-source shortcut. Preserving
  the printed entries has no signed invariant completion through four added
  terms, even allowing diagonal entries; and in the signed invariant
  torsion-support search through five nonzero entries, every integrable branch
  has h1=2 rather than h1=3. The selected D_E must therefore come from typed
  monad/Cech data or non-invariant spectral Galerkin data.

post_invariant_way_forward_certificate.json
  records the selected way forward after the sparse invariant A01 route is
  exhausted: typed monad/Cech cohomology is primary, non-invariant spectral
  Galerkin is fallback, and both must construct H^1(X,E), anti-family
  vanishing, Psi_i representatives, sector projections, metrics/projectors,
  dotD_alpha1, and Green operators before primitive C1 blocks can be filled.

iwasawa_typed_monad_section_recovery_certificate.json
  records the attempted recovery of those typed monad sections from the current
  corpus. The monad sequence, Chern labels, generic-map phrase, literal A01,
  and rank-one Yukawa seed are present, but explicit typed f_i,g_i sections,
  transition data, Cech maps, selected H^1(X,E) representatives, anti-family
  vanishing, sector projections, and dotD/Green data are not. This triggers the
  non-invariant spectral Galerkin fallback as the next executable branch.

iwasawa_spectral_operator_gate_certificate.json
  records the first gate on that fallback branch. It reduces the next task to
  selected operator and basis data: one admissible D_E source, a non-invariant
  finite basis B_N, Gram matrix, Galerkin matrix L_N, Riesz projector,
  complement gap/error bound, and explicit Psi_i representatives. It closes the
  input contract, not the spectral values.

iwasawa_non_invariant_galerkin_protocol_certificate.json
  turns the active fallback into a finite execution protocol. Given one
  selected D_E source, it builds nested non-invariant spaces V_N, Gram matrices
  G_N, stiffness matrices K_N=<D_E b_i,D_E b_j>, the generalized eigenproblem
  K_N v=lambda G_N v, a G_N-Riesz family projector, and the gap/error rule
  epsilon_low+eta_total < tau < gamma_gap-eta_total. Values remain open until
  D_E and a first basis are supplied.

iwasawa_galerkin_basis_skeleton_certificate.json
  closes the form/fiber tensor-product bookkeeping for that first basis:
  b=(phi_m tensor fiber_a tensor baromega_I), rank_E=3, form counts
  (1,3,3,1), invariant dimensions (3,9,9,3), and first non-invariant extension
  dimensions (6,18,18,6). The scalar quotient/deck basis, bundle transition
  matrices, quadrature, selected D_E action, Gram entries, and stiffness entries
  remain open.

iwasawa_standard_lattice_deck_scaffold_certificate.json
  formulates a standard Gaussian-lattice candidate Gamma0=Z[i]^3 on the complex
  Heisenberg group, with coframe omega1=dz1, omega2=dz2, omega3=z1 dz2-dz3 and
  deck generators g1..g6. The action preserves the coframe and supplies scalar
  and bundle gluing laws. It is not claimed to be MTT-selected; scalar modes,
  bundle transitions, selected D_E action, and matrix entries remain open.

iwasawa_scalar_deck_mode_filter_certificate.json
  turns the candidate deck generators into six scalar gluing equations and a
  central-character split phi=exp(2*pi*i*(k1*t1+k2*t2))*F_k. The k=(0,0)
  sector admits ordinary four-torus Fourier modes; nonzero central sectors
  require twisted theta/magnetic or finite-element boundary conditions. It
  closes the scalar admissibility filter, not selected modes, rho_E, D_E, or
  Galerkin matrices.

iwasawa_scalar_fe_gluing_certificate.json
  instantiates the scalar finite-element route on an N-subdivision six-cell.
  The inverse nonabelian boundary maps identify (N+1)^6 closed-cell nodes into
  N^6 scalar quotient degrees of freedom, with one half-open representative
  per equivalence class in audited samples N=1..4. This closes scalar nodal
  gluing, not bundle rho_E, shape functions, quadrature, D_E, or matrices.

iwasawa_bundle_fe_gluing_contract_certificate.json
  lifts scalar FE gluing to rank-three bundle sections by requiring
  u(source)=rho_E(gamma,target)u(target), with rho_E invertibility, cocycle,
  and metric-compatibility certificates. The identity-rho smoke test gives
  3*N^6 bundle dofs, but identity rho_E is not selected data. Actual rho_E,
  sector projections, selected D_E, and matrices remain open.

iwasawa_bundle_rhoE_data.template.json
  future fill-in slot for selected rho_E(g_j,z) transition data, cocycle and
  metric compatibility, and Q,u,d,L,e,N,H sector projections.

iwasawa_rhoE_source_recovery_certificate.json
  records the attempted recovery of actual rho_E transition data from the
  current corpus. It finds rank-three/topological monad/HYM-existence
  structure, but not rho_E(g1..g6), line-bundle transitions, Cech cocycles,
  typed maps, metric compatibility, or sector projections. It rejects identity
  rho_E, c1(E)=0, generic local constants, and q79 as shortcuts.

iwasawa_rhoE_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_rhoE.py, an executable validator for future
  constant-generator rho_E candidates. It refuses the open template with exit
  code 2, checks 3x3 determinants and Iwasawa group relations, accepts identity
  only as a schema smoke test, and fails a bad noncommuting candidate. Actual
  selected rho_E remains open.

iwasawa_rhoE_mesh_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_rhoE_mesh.py, an executable validator for
  finite-mesh boundary-target rho_E tables on the Iwasawa FE cell. It checks
  mesh_N, generator target lookup, determinant nonvanishing on visited targets,
  and corner path-independence; selected rho_E, metric compatibility, sector
  maps, D_E, and matrices remain open.

iwasawa_rhoE_metric_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_rhoE_metric.py, an executable Hermitian metric
  compatibility validator for finite-mesh rho_E data. It checks positive
  definite Hermitian metric data and rho_E^* H(source) rho_E=H(target) on
  boundary faces; selected rho_E, selected HYM metric, sector maps, D_E, and
  matrices remain open.

iwasawa_sector_projection_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_sector_maps.py, an executable validator for
  finite-projector Q,u,d,L,e,N,H sector maps. It checks family/Higgs
  dimensions, Hermitian idempotent projector ranks, and rho_E-invariance on
  boundary faces; selected sector origin, sector-specific D_E actions, and
  overlap matrices remain open.

iwasawa_de_action_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_de_action.py, an executable finite D_E action
  validator for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H operator slots. It checks domain/range Gram
  matrices, K=D_E^*G_rangeD_E stiffness assembly, kernel dimensions, and
  orthonormal zero-mode bases; actual selected D_E, Riesz gap, dotD, Green
  operators, and overlaps remain open.

iwasawa_riesz_gap_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_riesz_gap.py, an executable finite Riesz
  projector and gap/error validator for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H spectral slots. It checks
  generalized low eigenpairs K v=lambda G v, Gram-orthogonal projector
  equations, and epsilon_low+eta<tau<gamma-eta isolation; actual selected
  spectral data, dotD, Green operators, and overlaps remain open.

iwasawa_reduced_green_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_reduced_green.py, an executable finite reduced
  Green-operator validator for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H slots. It checks Q=I-P,
  A=G^-1K, A R=Q, R A=Q, Green support on the complement, Gram
  self-adjointness, and the gap-derived norm bound; selected Green data, dotD,
  horizontal responses, and overlaps remain open.

iwasawa_dotd_response_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_dotd_response.py, an executable finite
  dotD_alpha1 response validator for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H slots. It checks
  source_i=Q dotD psi_i, dotPsi_i=-R source_i, P dotPsi_i=0, complement
  support, and A dotPsi_i+source_i=0; selected dotD origin, primitive
  contractions, and Yukawa matrices remain open.

selected_missing_data_calculation_certificate.json
  adds scripts/calculate_missing_selected_data.py, an executable scan of the
  current repository. It calculates that the first blocker is
  selected_operator_source, no filled selected operator/spectral/Green/dotD
  slot data are present outside validator schemas, and 24 primitive C1 3x3
  matrices remain missing before selected C1 matrices can be computed.

iwasawa_diagnostic_h1_three_spectral_pipeline_certificate.json
  records a dry run of the finite Hodge/Galerkin extraction on a known
  unselected sparse h1=3 candidate. It constructs L_1, an exact kernel
  projector, and three representatives, proving the machinery works once a
  valid D is supplied. It explicitly does not select the candidate or close the
  SM branch.

iwasawa_selected_de_construction_attempt_certificate.json
  evaluates the three admissible selected-D_E routes after the diagnostic
  pipeline succeeds. Corrected non-invariant Dolbeault data and typed monad
  sections are absent; direct HYM is available only as abstract Li-Yau
  existence, not as computable connection coefficients or matrix data. The next
  new datum must be one concrete selected connection/operator source.

iwasawa_route_c_finite_solve_scaffold_certificate.json
  adds scripts/scaffold_iwasawa_route_c_solver.py and
  scripts/validate_iwasawa_route_c_residuals.py. Route C is now branch-aware:
  any complete residual certificate must carry either the m=1/q=79/F packet or
  the m=2/q=369/F* packet, retain the antiunitary conjugate branch for
  comparison, and require dotD_alpha1 to be the derivative of the same selected
  branch. The template remains OPEN until actual residual, rho_E, metric, D_E,
  Riesz, Green, and dotD data are supplied.

iwasawa_route_c_branch_smoke_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_iwasawa_route_c_branch_smoke.py and
  candidate_data/iwasawa_route_c_branch_smoke. It builds both conjugate branch
  packets at mesh_N=1 with identity rho_E/metric, sector maps, finite D_E,
  Riesz, Green, and nonzero branch-phased dotD response. Honest files keep
  selected-origin flags false; temporary lifted-origin smoke copies pass every
  algebraic validator. The blocker is therefore a genuine selected
  HYM/Strominger residual solve, not the finite validator pipeline.

iwasawa_route_c_smoke_c1_dependency_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_route_c_smoke_c1_dependency.py and
  candidate_data/iwasawa_route_c_smoke_c1_dependency.candidate.json. It maps
  the branch-smoke dotD responses to the primitive C1 contraction boundary:
  q79/q369 response coefficients are conjugate; with a universal E6 tensor and
  no selected SU(5) sector split, Delta_t=(0,0); full C1 matrices still need
  15 selected overlap slots per sector, and heavy links need 5 per sector.

su5_projection_tensor_derivation_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/derive_su5_projection_tensor_attempt.py and
  candidate_data/su5_projection_tensor_derivation_attempt.candidate.json. It
  derives the finite branch-aware projection tensor conditionally: q79 has
  T_u=I3 and T_d=F, while q369 has T_d=F*. The polarization validator, C1
  Delta_t calculator, and CKM heavy-link gate pass, but selected-source
  promotion remains false until U10/Ubar5 are derived from selected zero-mode,
  monad/Cech, Galerkin, or gerbe/twisted-bundle data.

selected_su5_source_proof_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_selected_su5_source_proof.py and
  candidate_data/selected_su5_source_proof_attempt.candidate.json. It attempts
  the remaining selected-source lemma directly by checking the conditional
  tensor, selected packet fill, typed monad/Cech route, Galerkin route, Route C
  smoke route, projective gerbe/twisted route, and torsion/orientation route.
  All current routes are blocked by absent selected operator/source data, so
  the remaining proof is exactly the selected U10/Ubar5 source packet.

su5_block_orientation_route_split_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_su5_block_orientation_route_split.py and
  candidate_data/su5_block_orientation_route_split.candidate.json. It compares
  the monolithic SU(5) tensor route with the block-factorized trivial-Higgs
  route. The current block packets are left/right-sector coherent but not
  uniform on whole 10_M/bar5_M multiplets, so the block route does not by
  itself source T_u=I3,T_d=F; it instead requires sector-resolved C1/dotD
  overlap data unless a separate high-scale SU(5)/E6 source is selected.

dual_route_closure_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_dual_route_closure.py and
  candidate_data/dual_route_closure_attempt.candidate.json. It tries both
  continuations: Route A remains blocked by absence of a selected high-scale
  SU(5)/E6 multiplet source, while Route B computes the sector-resolved block
  heavy-link map. The Route B map has complex rank two from five selected u-d
  overlap-difference variables to Delta_t, so nonzero CKM heavy-link mismatch
  is structurally possible but selected overlap/C1 primitive values remain
  open.

route_b_heavy_link_overlap_difference_calculator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/compute_route_b_heavy_link_delta_t.py and
  certificates/route_b_heavy_link_overlap_differences.template.json. It
  defines the executable five-slot Route B packet mapping selected u-d
  overlap differences plus selected theta/vertex/basis corrections to Delta_t.
  The open template is refused and unselected algebraic witnesses do not
  promote to CKM input; selected overlap/C1 primitive values remain open.

route_b_final_missing_object_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/calculate_route_b_final_missing_object.py and
  candidate_data/route_b_final_missing_object_attempt.candidate.json. It
  calculates the strongest current Route B object from U10=I3,Ubar5=F:
  Delta_t=(1/sqrt(3),omega^2/sqrt(3)), carried by basis_connection_delta with
  all five overlap-difference slots zero. The packet is exact but conditional,
  because the upstream SU(5) qutrit polarization source is still unselected.

selected_fourier_transport_proof_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_selected_fourier_transport_proof.py and
  candidate_data/selected_fourier_transport_proof_attempt.candidate.json. It
  attempts to prove selected U10=I3,Ubar5=F from MTT geometry. The finite
  Fourier transport and exact Route B object are closed, but all current
  source-promotion routes remain blocked; the correct closing object is a
  selected Gerbe-Fourier polarization promotion packet or equivalent selected
  zero-mode derivation.

selected_gerbe_fourier_type_theorem_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_selected_gerbe_fourier_type.py and
  candidate_data/selected_gerbe_fourier_type_theorem.candidate.json. It
  proves the next layer: MTT structural sources plus the finite Z3 torsion
  calculation select the nontrivial gerbe/qutrit Fourier phase-space type up
  to the global conjugate orientation {F,F*}. It explicitly does not claim the
  ordered SU(5) packet U10=I3,Ubar5=F until selected matter-slot source data
  prove 10_M=clock, bar5_M=shift, and the q79 orientation.

time_oriented_conjugate_branch_selection_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_time_oriented_conjugate_branch_selection.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_conjugate_branch_selection.candidate.json. It
  proves the retarded representative theorem: the selected exact/charge branch
  has K_ret,64=S^-1, q64=15, and q7=2, hence q=79 mod 448, while the
  q=369/F* branch is retained as the global antiunitary conjugate. This closes
  branch selection only after time orientation is supplied; it does not select
  the ordered SU(5) matter-slot packet.

time_oriented_fixed_gerbe_representative_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_time_oriented_fixed_gerbe_representative.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_fixed_gerbe_representative.candidate.json. It
  closes the finite torsion representative on the time-oriented branch:
  q79/F carries m=1 and q369/F* is retained as m=2. This is not a full selected
  twisted-source packet; Deligne/Cech period data, Freed-Witten, projector
  retention, selected D_E/dotD, and primitive C1 contractions remain open.

time_oriented_m1_gerbe_period_table_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_time_oriented_m1_gerbe_period_table.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_m1_gerbe_period_table.candidate.json. It turns
  the q79/F,m=1 representative into an explicit finite F_3^2 B-field/Cech
  period table B_1((a,b),(c,d))=-cb/3 mod Z, verifies normalization, checks
  delta B=0 on all 729 triples, and obtains the qutrit Heisenberg commutator
  [[0,1],[2,0]]. This closes the finite quotient table only; the geometric
  Deligne/Cech representative, Freed-Witten, projector retention, and selected
  D_E/dotD operator source remain open.

time_oriented_m1_deck_cech_lift_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_time_oriented_m1_deck_cech_lift.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_m1_deck_cech_lift.candidate.json. It pulls the
  finite q79/F,m=1 table back along the Iwasawa deck quotient pi(g1)=(1,0),
  pi(g2)=(0,1), pi(g3..g6)=(0,0), checks generator-level delta B=0, checks the
  active F_3^2 quotient, and matches rho(g1)rho(g2)=zeta_3 rho(g2)rho(g1) in
  the qutrit projective carrier. This closes the finite deck/Cech pullback,
  not smooth Deligne embedding, Freed-Witten, projector retention, or selected
  D_E/dotD source data.

time_oriented_m1_flat_gerbe_promotion_certificate.json
  adds scripts/promote_time_oriented_m1_deck_cech_to_flat_gerbe.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_m1_flat_gerbe_promotion.candidate.json. It
  conditionally promotes the deck cocycle to a zero-curvature flat
  Deligne/Cech gerbe on the candidate aspherical Iwasawa deck scaffold, checks
  qutrit projective-module compatibility, keeps the finite block projectors
  algebraically compatible, and reduces Freed-Witten to separate W3 and
  3-torsion restriction checks. The promotion remains conditional because
  Gamma0/cover selection, selected cycles, full Green-Schwarz curvature,
  projector retention, and selected D_E/dotD are still open.

time_oriented_m1_freed_witten_cycle_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_time_oriented_m1_freed_witten_cycle_gate.py,
  scripts/validate_time_oriented_m1_selected_cycle_restrictions.py, and
  certificates/time_oriented_m1_selected_cycle_restrictions.template.json. It
  turns the m=1 Freed-Witten DD(B) restriction into a finite test: a selected
  cycle passes the 3-torsion gerbe part exactly when its active F_3^2 image has
  rank zero or one, while an image spanning g1 and g2 is obstructed. Selected
  cycle data and complete active F_3^2 images are still required before
  Freed-Witten/projector promotion can close.

time_oriented_m1_qutrit_line_cycle_restrictions_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_time_oriented_m1_qutrit_line_cycle_restrictions.py,
  certificates/time_oriented_m1_qutrit_line_cycle_restrictions.selected.json,
  and candidate_data/time_oriented_m1_qutrit_line_cycle_restrictions.candidate.json.
  It fills the selected-cycle validator for the two q79/F,m=1 finite qutrit
  polarization lines: clock <(1,0)> and shift <(0,1)>. Both are rank-one active
  F_3^2 images, so DD(B)|Y=0, and the line representatives are recorded as
  W3-zero/spinC. This does not supply the complete visible cycle or brane list,
  nor full Freed-Witten, projector retention, D_E/dotD, or SM closure.

visible_complex_worldvolume_spinc_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_visible_complex_worldvolume_spinc_gate.py,
  candidate_data/visible_complex_worldvolume_spinc_gate.candidate.json, and
  proof_corpus/Visible_Complex_Worldvolume_SpinC_Gate_v1.md. It uses the
  execution corpus D7 divisors S1,S2,S3 and matter curves Cij=S_i cap S_j in
  the CY corner to close the W3/spinC side for the visible complex-worldvolume
  class: complex divisors and complex curve intersections are canonically
  spinC, so W3=0. It does not supply active F_3^2 images, DD(B) restrictions,
  selected visible operator/source promotion, projector retention, D_E/dotD, or
  SM closure.

visible_active_f3_image_recovery_obstruction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_active_f3_image_recovery.py,
  candidate_data/visible_active_f3_image_recovery_obstruction.candidate.json,
  and proof_corpus/Visible_Active_F3_Image_Recovery_Obstruction_v1.md. It
  enumerates the nine literal coordinate-tangent assignments of the two active
  qutrit generators to the factorized CY corner and proves that none makes all
  three coordinate D7 divisors S1,S2,S3 isotropic: at least one divisor always
  has rank-two active F_3^2 image and fails the m=1 DD(B) gate. This blocks
  only the naive coordinate-divisor fill; non-coordinate/isotropic active
  images, trivial pullback placement, or explicit twisted Chan-Paton/flux
  cancellation remain open routes.

visible_twisted_chan_paton_rescue_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_twisted_chan_paton_rescue.py and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_chan_paton_rescue.candidate.json. It checks
  the explicit twisted Chan-Paton escape hatch for the coordinate CY corner:
  when the two active qutrit generators are placed in distinct coordinate
  factors, all three matter curves Cij are ordinary/isotropic and exactly one
  D7 divisor sees the full F_3^2 plane. The existing qutrit projective carrier
  validates as a projective module with the same zeta3 twist as the q79/F,m=1
  period table. Thus the finite coordinate rescue is reduced to choosing which
  one of S1,S2,S3 carries the projective Chan-Paton module. Selection,
  geometric gerbe/worldvolume-flux source, HYM/operator-source promotion,
  projector retention, D_E/dotD, and SM closure remain open.

visible_twisted_d7_volume_selector_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_select_visible_twisted_d7_by_volume.py and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_d7_volume_selector_attempt.candidate.json.
  It uses the executed CY-corner Kahler data tau1=tau2 and tau3/tau1=0.229
  to show that S3 is the unique volume-anisotropic candidate in the finite
  twisted Chan-Paton rescue family. This is conditional only: the MTT rule
  attaching the qutrit projective twist to the unique small-volume/zeta3
  divisor still must be proved, and S3 source/projector/D_E/dotD/SM closure
  remain open.

visible_twisted_d7_qutrit_symmetry_selector_certificate.json
  adds scripts/derive_s3_selector_from_qutrit_symmetry.py and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_d7_qutrit_symmetry_selector.candidate.json.
  It combines the selected qutrit clock/shift lines, their Fourier-dual
  exchange symmetry, the executed t1=t2 unequal-to-t3 CY scales, and the finite
  twisted Chan-Paton rescue enumeration. Under the still-open rule that the
  selected F_3^2-to-CY embedding preserves clock/shift symmetry unless a
  selected source breaks it, only the T1,T2 active pair is allowed, hence the
  twisted D7 stack is S3. This does not construct the selected S3 source.

visible_twisted_d7_equivariant_embedding_selector_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_s3_equivariant_embedding_selector.py and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_d7_equivariant_embedding_selector.candidate.json.
  It closes the minimal selector rule using MTT symmetry-compatible survivor
  labeling and the ban on coordinate-artifact branch selection: without an
  extra selected orientation-breaking source, the qutrit clock/shift pair must
  embed in the unique equal-scale CY coordinate pair T1,T2, hence the twisted
  D7 stack is S3. S1/S2 are retired only at the minimal selector level; an
  explicit selected source could still reopen them, and the selected S3 source
  remains open.

visible_twisted_s3_source_packet_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_visible_twisted_s3_source_packet.py,
  scripts/attempt_visible_twisted_s3_source_packet.py,
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_source_packet.template.json, and
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_source_packet.attempt.json. The attempt
  packet fills the selected stack S3, q79/F,m=1 branch, active pair T1,T2,
  finite gerbe label zeta_3^2, and S3 twisted Chan-Paton rescue inputs. The
  validator rejects it until a selected S3 Deligne/Cech, B-field,
  worldvolume-flux, or twisted Chan-Paton source certificate verifies the
  central-cocycle map, Green-Schwarz/Bianchi condition, Freed-Witten condition,
  and projector retention.

visible_twisted_s3_finite_cp_cancellation_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_visible_twisted_s3_finite_cp_cancellation.py and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_s3_finite_cp_cancellation.candidate.json. It
  closes the finite quotient cancellation statement for the selected S3 stack:
  ordinary DD(B)|S3 is nonzero because S3 sees the full active F_3^2 plane, but
  the matching q79/F,m=1 qutrit projective Chan-Paton module supplies the
  finite twisted-bundle cancellation, while S1, S2, and all Cij matter curves
  remain ordinary. It does not construct the smooth selected S3 source,
  Green-Schwarz/Bianchi lift, full Freed-Witten refinement, projector
  retention, D_E/dotD, or SM closure.

visible_twisted_s3_smooth_source_lift_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_visible_twisted_s3_smooth_source_lift.py,
  scripts/attempt_visible_twisted_s3_smooth_source_lift.py,
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_smooth_source_lift.template.json,
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_smooth_source_lift.attempt.json, and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_s3_smooth_source_lift_attempt.candidate.json.
  It combines finite S3 twisted-CP cancellation with the conditional flat
  Deligne/Cech gerbe into an executable conditional smooth-source model. The
  validator still refuses promotion until selected cover/good-cover data,
  smooth S3 restriction, smooth Freed-Witten cancellation, and projector
  retention are supplied.

iwasawa_deligne_cover_gauge_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_iwasawa_deligne_cover_gauge_reduction.py and
  candidate_data/iwasawa_deligne_cover_gauge_reduction.candidate.json. It
  proves that the particular good cover is auxiliary representative data for a
  Deligne/Cech gerbe, not an independent physical MTT selection knob. The
  selected-source blocker is therefore reduced to the fixed smooth S3
  differential-cohomology class, its S3 restriction, smooth Freed-Witten
  cancellation, and block-sector projector retention.

visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet.py,
  scripts/attempt_visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet.py,
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet.template.json,
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet.attempt.json, and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet_attempt.candidate.json.
  It carries finite S3 twisted-CP cancellation, W3/spinC, and the cover-gauge
  reduction into the refined post-cover executable target. The attempt is
  rejected until the fixed smooth S3 flat class, S3 pullback table, smooth
  Freed-Witten cancellation, and projector retention are supplied.

visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_closure_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_closure.py,
  certificates/visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_packet.selected.json, and
  candidate_data/visible_twisted_s3_class_restriction_closure.candidate.json.
  It closes the refined post-cover target: the selected q79/F,m=1 flat
  Deligne representative has H=0, restricts to S3 through the explicit F_3^2
  table B((a,b),(c,d))=-c*b/3, matches the qutrit central cocycle, cancels the
  S3 rank-two DD obstruction by the same-branch twisted CP module, and retains
  the block-factorized family/Higgs projectors. It does not construct the
  selected visible operator source, coherent spectral zero-mode projectors,
  selected D_E/dotD, C1 contractions, or SM closure.

time_oriented_m1_qutrit_line_cycle_restrictions.selected.json
  selected packet consumed by
  scripts/validate_time_oriented_m1_selected_cycle_restrictions.py. It verifies
  only the clock and shift line representatives selected by the finite
  gerbe-Fourier/qutrit type; it is not a replacement for the future complete
  visible worldvolume packet.

time_oriented_m1_selected_cycle_restrictions.template.json
  future fill-in slot for the selected cycles or branes, their images in the
  active F_3^2 torsion quotient, DD(B)|Y zero claims, and W3=0 or spinC
  certificates consumed by
  scripts/validate_time_oriented_m1_selected_cycle_restrictions.py.

time_oriented_m1_green_schwarz_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_time_oriented_m1_green_schwarz_gate.py,
  scripts/validate_time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature.py, and
  certificates/time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature.template.json.
  It proves the flat m=1 torsion representative is curvature-invisible
  (H=0): it preserves the already closed Fu-Yau/Mukai charge-sector Bianchi
  equation and cannot repair a missing visible SM curvature residual. The
  visible Green-Schwarz equation remains open until selected same-branch
  coefficients for dH, Tr R_+^2, and Tr F_visible^2 are supplied.

time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature.template.json
  future fill-in slot for selected visible Green-Schwarz curvature data on the
  q79/F,m=1 branch. The validator checks the coefficient equation
  residual = dH - (Tr R_+^2 - Tr F_visible^2) and refuses benchmark or observed
  flavor inputs.

time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_requirement_certificate.json
  adds scripts/derive_time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_requirement.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_requirement.candidate.json.
  It uses the closed Iwasawa rows dH=-4*r3^2 alpha_1 and
  Tr R_+^2=8*r3^2/(r1^2*r2^2) alpha_1 to derive the exact visible gauge row
  required by zero residual:
  Tr F_visible^2=(8*r3^2/(r1^2*r2^2)+4*r3^2) alpha_1, with alpha_2 and
  alpha_3 components zero. It does not construct the selected visible bundle or
  operator source realizing that row.

time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature_closure_certificate.json
  adds scripts/close_time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_curvature.py and
  certificates/time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature.selected.json.
  It closes the visible Green-Schwarz equation at curvature level by validating
  the exact symbolic Iwasawa rows against the derived requirement certificate:
  dH, Tr R_+^2, and Tr F_visible^2 have zero Bianchi residual. This remains a
  curvature-only source; visible SM operator source, projector retention,
  D_E/dotD, and C1 contractions stay open.

time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_source_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_source.py,
  scripts/attempt_time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_source.py,
  certificates/time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_source.template.json, and
  certificates/time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_source.attempt.json. The attempt
  packet carries the exact required Tr F_visible^2 row, but the validator
  rejects it because selected_by_mtt, selected visible bundle model,
  Chern-Weil derivation from source, and HYM/Route-C residual verification are
  still absent.

time_oriented_m1_deresponse_target_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_time_oriented_m1_deresponse_target.py and
  candidate_data/time_oriented_m1_deresponse_target.candidate.json. It checks
  the fixed q79/F,m=1 de_response target: current honest packets fail without
  selected source, but a temporary lifted-source consistency packet passes
  Route C, D_E, Riesz, Green, dotD, selected-source promotion, and selected HYM
  operator-source gates. This proves finite stack coherence only; the actual
  selected visible bundle/twisted source remains open.

su5_matter_slot_transversality_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_su5_matter_slot_transversality.py and
  candidate_data/su5_matter_slot_transversality.candidate.json. It proves the
  finite uniqueness theorem under the explicit matter-slot transversality
  hypothesis: common SU(5) family transport is gauge, transverse qutrit
  transport is nonzero, and the retarded q79 branch selects U10=I3,Ubar5=F up
  to common gauge. The selected MTT source for that transversality remains
  open, so the ordered packet is not yet promoted to selected SM data.

selected_matter_slot_transversality_source_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_selected_matter_slot_transversality_source.py and
  selected_matter_slot_transversality_source.template.json. It defines the
  strict upstream source gate required before the finite transversality theorem
  can be promoted: selected source certificate, retarded q79/F branch, common
  family frame, selected metrics, projector retention, zero-mode bases, and
  U10^dagger C Ubar5=F, with observed and benchmark flavor inputs forbidden.

selected_matter_slot_transversality_source_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_fill_selected_matter_slot_transversality_source.py and
  selected_matter_slot_transversality_source.attempt.json. The first Route C
  fill attempt carries the finite U10=I3,Ubar5=F shape but fails the source
  validator because honest Route C selected-origin, D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD,
  selected projector retention, and selected zero-mode-basis evidence remain
  absent.

selected_matter_source_two_path_exploration_certificate.json
  adds scripts/explore_selected_matter_source_two_paths.py and
  candidate_data/selected_matter_source_two_path_exploration.candidate.json.
  It compares the selected HYM/Strominger source route with the spectral
  Galerkin zero-mode route. The result is intentionally guarded: neither path
  closes alone from the current data. The rigorous next path is hybrid, with
  HYM/Strominger supplying the selected operator/source origin and spectral
  Galerkin computing zero modes, L2 metrics, projectors, Green data, dotD, and
  U10/Ubar5.

selected_hym_operator_source_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_selected_hym_operator_source.py,
  scripts/attempt_selected_hym_operator_source.py, and
  selected_hym_operator_source.template.json. It tries the strongest current
  Path A fill: closed Fu-Yau/Strominger charge-sector data plus q79/F Route C
  branch-smoke files. The validator rejects this because charge-sector closure
  is not yet a selected visible SM bundle/operator source, and Route C residual,
  selected-source promotion, D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, and projector-retention
  gates fail honestly.

visible_operator_source_blocker_resolution_certificate.json
  adds scripts/resolve_visible_operator_source_blocker.py and
  candidate_data/visible_operator_source_blocker_resolution.candidate.json. It
  checks the closed charge-sector route, typed monad/Cech route, direct Route C
  finite solve, bundle FE gluing, discrete gerbe/projector, spectral Galerkin,
  and external heterotic-template routes. All are blocked by the same cut set:
  selected visible SM bundle model, constructed matter operator source,
  selected Route C residual, selected D_E, selected Riesz/Green, and selected
  dotD flags. The result rules out silent promotion from existing certificates.

visible_operator_source_after_s3_closure_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_operator_source_after_s3_closure.py and
  candidate_data/visible_operator_source_after_s3_closure.candidate.json. It
  consumes the selected S3 class/restriction closure and visible
  Green-Schwarz curvature closure to retire the old gerbe, S3 pullback,
  smooth Freed-Witten, and block-sector projector blockers. The remaining cut
  set is the selected visible Chern-Weil/operator source: selected
  bundle/sheaf or Route-C source, source-derived Tr_F row, HYM/Route-C
  residual, same-source D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green, coherent spectral projectors,
  and primitive C1 contractions.

visible_chern_weil_formal_source_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_visible_chern_weil_formal_source.py and
  candidate_data/visible_chern_weil_formal_source.candidate.json. It proves the
  required visible Tr F^2 row has no formal trace-free Chern-Weil obstruction:
  a rank-two block with eigenvalues (+f,-f) and
  f^2=4*r3^2/(r1^2*r2^2)+2*r3^2 realizes the required alpha_1 coefficient and
  has zero alpha_2/alpha_3 support. This is not an integral selected bundle,
  HYM/Route-C residual, D_E/dotD packet, or SM closure.

visible_chern_weil_quantization_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_chern_weil_quantization_gate.py and
  candidate_data/visible_chern_weil_quantization_gate.candidate.json. It
  separates the absorbed Green-Schwarz row from the unabsorbed Chern-Weil
  period-normalized row, records the conditional consistency of the existing
  u1=8*(2*pi)^2 C1 support row as coefficient-label 8 or standard-instanton
  label 4 depending on trace convention, and keeps the visible bundle/sheaf or
  Route-C source, trace convention, period basis, HYM residual, and D_E/dotD
  data open.

visible_integral_chern_source_candidate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/audit_visible_integral_chern_source_candidate.py and
  candidate_data/visible_integral_chern_source_candidate.candidate.json. It
  promotes the quantization gate to an explicit integral candidate:
  n=(1,2,0),(-1,-2,0) gives c1=0 and standard ch2 label 4 on alpha_1. It also
  proves the split abelian shortcut is not a selected HYM source because the
  individual summands fail primitivity for positive radii; the next source must
  be nonabelian stable/sheaf data or an honest Route-C solve for the same class.

visible_split_line_hym_no_go_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_visible_split_line_hym_no_go.py and
  candidate_data/visible_split_line_hym_no_go.candidate.json. It proves a
  general no-go: if every split line/Cartan summand is individually primitive,
  then S p=0 for a positive slope vector p, but the positive alpha_1 target
  requires S12=4 and gives S11*p1+4*p2>0. Thus no split line-bundle or diagonal
  Cartan HYM source can realize the visible row; only nonabelian stable/sheaf
  data or Route-C remain.

visible_stable_source_sign_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_stable_source_sign_gate.py and
  candidate_data/visible_stable_source_sign_gate.candidate.json. It closes the
  stable-source sign guardrail: for a stable SU(r) HYM source with c1=0,
  integral c2(E) wedge J_G must be nonnegative, while ch2_math=-c2. Therefore
  the positive visible trace row must be read as c2=+4 alpha_1 and
  ch2_math=-4 alpha_1. Reading it as positive mathematical ch2 would violate
  the stable-source sign gate. The source itself remains open.

iwasawa_monad_visible_source_role_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_monad_visible_source_role.py and
  candidate_data/iwasawa_monad_visible_source_role.candidate.json. It separates
  the printed Iwasawa monad's matter/zero-mode role from the visible curvature
  source role: the monad has c1=0, c2=0, and int c3=6, while the visible source
  now requires c2=+4 alpha_1. Therefore the monad alone cannot be the visible
  alpha_1 Chern-Weil source. A larger visible bundle is allowed only after
  recomputing total Chern classes, zero modes, D_E, dotD, Riesz/Green, and
  projectors from that enlarged selected source.

visible_additive_source_factor_route_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_additive_source_factor_route.py and
  candidate_data/visible_additive_source_factor_route.candidate.json. It
  formulates the clean additive accounting route
  E_total=E_matter_monad direct_sum V_alpha: with the monad carrying c2=0 and
  int c3=6, a genuinely nonabelian V_alpha with c1=0, c2=+4 alpha_1, and c3=0
  gives total c1=0, total c2=+4 alpha_1, and total int c3=6. This is only
  topology: V_alpha selection, HYM/Strominger residuals, E8 commutant/SM
  dictionary protection, and same-total-source D_E/dotD remain open.

visible_rank2_extension_valpha_route_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_rank2_extension_valpha_route.py and
  candidate_data/visible_rank2_extension_valpha_route.candidate.json. It
  reduces the minimal V_alpha target to non-split rank-two extensions
  0 -> L -> V_alpha -> L^-1 -> 0 with c2(V_alpha)=-c1(L)^2. Four primitive
  line classes, (1,-2,0), (-1,2,0), (2,-1,0), and (-2,1,0), give
  c2=+4 alpha_1 and have positive slope chambers where the displayed subline
  L has negative slope. This closes only the arithmetic/necessary-slope gate;
  H^1(X,L^2), a selected nonzero extension class, stability, HYM/Strominger
  residuals, and same-source D_E/dotD remain open.

visible_rank2_l2_ext_h1_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_rank2_l2_ext_h1_gate.py,
  scripts/validate_visible_rank2_l2_cohomology.py,
  candidate_data/visible_rank2_l2_ext_h1_gate.candidate.json, and
  certificates/visible_rank2_l2_cohomology_data.template.json. It turns the
  missing Ext^1(L^-1,L)=H^1(X,L^2) step into a finite cochain validation
  contract for C0 -> C1 -> C2, computing h1=dim ker(d1)-rank(d0) and checking
  that a proposed extension vector is closed and not exact. The first target is
  L=(1,-2,0), hence c1(L^2)=(2,-4,0); actual selected Cech/Dolbeault matrices,
  non-split stability, HYM/source selection, and same-source D_E/dotD remain
  open.

constants_gr_cross_repo_clues_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_constants_gr_cross_repo_clues.py and
  candidate_data/constants_gr_cross_repo_clues.candidate.json. It checks the
  sibling constants and GR repos and imports only method-level clues: selected
  source/operator packet discipline, same-branch source requirements,
  target-versus-source separation, and normalization guardrails. It explicitly
  does not import H^1(X,L^2), a nonzero Ext class, a selected V_alpha source,
  Qa/SU3 data as visible-bundle data, a GR Hessian as a visible operator, or
  any full SM-closure data.

visible_valpha_chern_bianchi_source_packet_candidates_certificate.json
  adds scripts/build_visible_valpha_chern_bianchi_source_packet_candidates.py
  and candidate_data/visible_valpha_chern_bianchi_source_packet_candidates.candidate.json.
  It turns the current visible-source options into an auditable hierarchy. The
  primary next branch is the non-split rank-two extension with L=(1,-2,0),
  c1(L^2)=(2,-4,0), c2(V_alpha)=+4 alpha_1, and ch2_math=-4 alpha_1. The
  abelian two-line row remains only as integral Chern/Bianchi support because
  the split HYM/primitivity gate fails; Route-C and twisted/S3 transfer remain
  fallback routes. Actual H^1(X,L^2), a nonzero Ext class, stability,
  HYM/Route-C residuals, and same-source D_E/dotD remain open.

visible_rank2_l2_cohomology_source_hunt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/hunt_visible_rank2_l2_cohomology_source.py and
  candidate_data/visible_rank2_l2_cohomology_source_hunt.candidate.json. It
  searches the repo, local MTT corpus, and adjacent Iwasawa certificates for a
  selected L^2 cochain packet with c1(L^2)=(2,-4,0). The hunt finds adjacent
  monad/Dolbeault data but no selected L^2 matrices or Ext vector. It rejects
  the flux A01 shortcut because it is a rank-three monad object and the literal
  matrix is already audited as non-integrable, rejects typed-monad reuse because
  no listed line or typed map slot matches (2,-4,0) and f,g sections are absent,
  and rejects diagnostic h1 candidates as unselected wrong-object tests.

visible_rank2_l2_invariant_dolbeault_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_visible_rank2_l2_invariant_dolbeault.py and
  candidate_data/visible_rank2_l2_invariant_dolbeault_attempt.candidate.json.
  It tests the simplest global scalar invariant Dolbeault ansatz
  D_A=dbar+A wedge on the Iwasawa anti-holomorphic basis. The scan over
  a_i in {-1,0,1} proves integrability iff a3=0. The trivial A=0 complex has
  h1=2 and passes the finite validator only as an unselected fixture; all
  nonzero integrable scalar candidates have h1=0. Since a global scalar
  potential lives on the trivial line and carries c1=0, this route cannot
  realize c1(L^2)=(2,-4,0). The next construction must supply transition or
  automorphy data for the nontrivial line bundle.

visible_rhoE_source_ansatz_search_certificate.json
  adds scripts/search_visible_rhoE_source_ansatz.py and
  candidate_data/visible_rhoE_source_ansatz_search.candidate.json. It tests the
  next ordinary rho_E escape hatches after the cut-set proof: central absorption
  of the qutrit phase into ordinary constant generators, scalar phase tables at
  N=2 over F2/F3, and constant perfect/non-solvable carriers. These routes do
  not produce the selected source; the remaining live target is selected
  D_E/dotD de_response data or a fixed selected gerbe/B-field representative.

iwasawa_selected_source_promotion_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_selected_source_promotion.py, an executable
  gate for promoting finite rho_E/D_E packets to selected proof evidence.
  Pure-gauge finite face tables fail rhoE-source promotion, while D_E-response
  promotion requires Route C, D_E, Riesz, Green, and dotD validators plus
  nonzero selected dotD source and horizontal response norms.

iwasawa_n1_phase_coboundary_obstruction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_n1_phase_coboundary_obstruction.py. At mesh
  N=1 the scalar phase flat solution space over F2,F3,F5,F7 has dimension 27
  and equals the source-key-compatible coboundary image. This retires scalar,
  diagonal, and constant-unitary-rotated phase tables as rhoE-source closure
  routes at N=1, without ruling out genuinely matrix-valued data or D_E
  response promotion.

iwasawa_n1_solvable_carrier_obstruction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_n1_solvable_carrier_obstruction.py. The N=1
  zero-H1 phase result lifts through derived quotients to block finite
  solvable matrix carriers whose abelian composition primes lie in F2,F3,F5,F7,
  including S3, dihedral, quaternion, Heisenberg, A4, and S4 source-level
  routes at N=1. Perfect/non-solvable carriers and D_E-response promotion
  remain open.

iwasawa_projective_magnetic_carrier_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_iwasawa_projective_magnetic_carrier.py. Qutrit
  clock/shift magnetic translations give a nontrivial central U(1) twist:
  ordinary rho_E mesh gluing fails, rho_E metric compatibility passes, and
  projective gerbe-style gluing holds. This is not selected rho_E data; it
  opens a twisted-bundle/B-field/discrete-torsion route that requires selected
  twist/Bianchi data or D_E-response promotion.

iwasawa_projective_rhoE_mesh_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_projective_rhoE_mesh.py, an executable
  central-phase corner validator for twisted finite rho_E data. It accepts the
  projective magnetic carrier, accepts strict ordinary gluing only as a trivial
  projective case, and rejects noncentral corrupted corner data. Selected
  gerbe/B-field origin, twisted Bianchi compatibility, and D_E remain open.

iwasawa_projective_twist_source_hunt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_projective_twist_cocycle.py and a corpus audit
  for the qutrit twist. The finite arithmetic closes as a nontrivial
  finite-Heisenberg Z3 cocycle, and the string/flux corpus aligns through
  Deligne gerbes, B-field/Hhat covariance, Green-Schwarz Bianchi, Fu-Yau, and
  Freed-Witten gates. The selected map from that cocycle to fixed gerbe periods,
  twisted projectors, and selected D_E/dotD data remains open.

iwasawa_twisted_source_promotion_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_twisted_source_promotion.py, the executable
  selected-source gate for the projective route. A passing packet must provide
  selected gerbe/B-field/discrete-torsion source data, the zeta3 holonomy map,
  Green-Schwarz Bianchi, Freed-Witten, coherent-projector retention, and
  projective rho_E/metric/sector validation. The current qutrit carrier remains
  unpromoted until those selected data exist.

iwasawa_twisted_source_packet_fill_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_fill_iwasawa_twisted_source_packet.py and the blocked
  packet certificates/iwasawa_twisted_source_promotion_packet.attempt.json. The
  finite cocycle, time-oriented m=1 period table, deck/Cech lift, conditional
  flat gerbe, finite Freed-Witten DD(B) gate, qutrit clock/shift line-cycle
  restrictions, Green-Schwarz preservation gate, required visible Tr F row,
  visible complex-worldvolume W3/spinC gate, naive coordinate active-image
  obstruction, finite twisted Chan-Paton rescue reduction, conditional S3
  volume selector attempt, qutrit-symmetry S3 reduction, minimal equivariant
  S3 selector, selected S3 source-packet gate, finite S3 twisted-CP
  cancellation, visible Green-Schwarz curvature packet, visible-source gate,
  projective rho_E table, metric path, and block-factorized sector maps are
  filled. The selected smooth S3 Deligne/Cech or worldvolume-flux source,
  selected
  visible operator/source promotion, selected projector retention, D_E/dotD,
  and primitive C1 contractions remain open. The
  old single-carrier obstruction is retained as a diagnostic: the irreducible
  qutrit carrier cannot carry rank-one H because Comm(X,Z)=C*I3, so H must stay
  on the separate ordinary line in the block-factorized route.

iwasawa_discrete_gerbe_holonomy_candidate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_discrete_gerbe_holonomy.py. It computes a flat
  Z3 B-field/discrete-torsion holonomy B((a,b),(a',b'))=-a'b/3 whose finite
  Bianchi residual is zero and whose holonomy exactly matches the qutrit
  zeta3 projective cocycle. This is a candidate map, not an MTT-selected gerbe
  representative or full heterotic Bianchi/Freed-Witten certificate.

iwasawa_flat_torsion_selection_gap_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_flat_torsion_selection_gap.py. It checks all
  three Z3 flat torsion labels and proves that each has zero finite Bianchi
  residual and leaves the Green-Schwarz curvature Hhat unchanged. The
  nontrivial labels match the qutrit cocycle and its conjugate, but the current
  curvature/Bianchi selection data cannot choose between them without an extra
  fixed differential-cohomology torsion label or selected gerbe period table.

iwasawa_torsion_label_four_route_selector_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_torsion_label_four_route_selector.py. It runs the
  four proposed selector routes: corpus evidence, finite topology,
  projector/zero-mode constraints, and orientation consistency. All four reject
  trivial m=0 and agree on the nontrivial conjugate pair m in {1,2}; none
  selects m=1 versus m=2 without a selected orientation convention or fixed
  differential-cohomology representative.

iwasawa_orientation_de_dotd_bridge_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_orientation_de_dotd_bridge.py. It maps the
  remaining orientation fork to two conjugate packets: m=1 with q=79 and SU(5)
  orientation F, and m=2 with q=369 and F*. The certificate rejects the
  two-unrelated-solutions interpretation and identifies an orientation-carrying
  selected D_E/dotD package, or an antiunitary-equivalence proof, as the first
  missing selector.

iwasawa_block_factorized_twist_route_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_block_factorized_twist_route.py. The naive
  rank-four repair diag(X,1), diag(Z,1) has a rank-one invariant Higgs line but
  fails scalar projective gluing because the corner ratio is diag(zeta3 I3,1).
  The correct route is therefore a block-factorized family-twist plus separate
  Higgs-carrier schema with new selected D_E/dotD contracts.

iwasawa_block_factorized_twisted_packet_candidate_certificate.json
  adds candidate_data/iwasawa_block_factorized_twisted_packet.candidate.json
  and scripts/validate_iwasawa_block_factorized_twisted_packet.py. The
  candidate validates the finite block architecture: qutrit projective family
  block, ordinary rank-one Higgs line, complete SM slot partition, and explicit
  rejection of the single rank-four scalar-projective shortcut. This is not a
  selected-source promotion; selected gerbe, Bianchi/Freed-Witten, D_E/dotD,
  primitive C1 contractions, and Yukawa weights remain open.

iwasawa_block_coupling_invariant_selection_rule_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_block_coupling_invariants.py. With a trivial
  Higgs line, the finite qutrit invariant-pairing rule is s_left+s_right=0 mod
  3. Thus nontrivial matter pairs are allowed only for conjugate orientations
  1+2 or 2+1; same-twist all-family assignments are blocked for ordinary SM
  Higgs pairs. This formulates the coupling rule but leaves the MTT-selected
  sector orientation assignment and all Yukawa magnitudes open.

iwasawa_block_factorized_sector_maps_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_iwasawa_block_factorized_sector_maps.py and
  candidate_data/iwasawa_block_factorized_sector_maps.candidate.json. The
  family slots Q,u,d,L,e,N validate as full rank-three projectors on the
  projective qutrit family block, while H validates on a separate ordinary
  rank-one line. This removes the old fake-H-inside-irreducible-qutrit
  obstruction for the block-factorized route, but selected gerbe/source,
  D_E, dotD, and Yukawa data remain open.

iwasawa_c6_orientation_branch_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_c6_orientation_branch_reduction.py. The qutrit
  pairing rule reduces the previously independent C6 q79/conjugate choices
  from 16 channel-sign assignments to four sector-orientation branches. If a
  later selected source proves Q/L doublet-orientation coherence, those four
  collapse to the global conjugate pair [79,79,79,79] and [369,369,369,369].
  The unique MTT branch, C6 amplitudes, and Yukawa magnitudes remain open.

iwasawa_c6_common_holonomy_branch_pair_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_c6_common_holonomy_branch_pair.py. It imports
  the no-proxy pairwise-bundle rule that quark and lepton phases sharing the
  same holonomy datum cannot be assigned independently, rejecting the two mixed
  quark/lepton C6 patterns. The surviving C6 orientation space is the global
  conjugate pair [79,79,79,79] and [369,369,369,369]. The final convention,
  C6 amplitudes, and Yukawa magnitudes remain open.

iwasawa_c6_global_phase_block_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_c6_global_phase_block.py. It computes the pure
  C6 phase block after common-holonomy reduction: all four C6 channels share
  chi_79 or its conjugate chi_369, with unit modulus and zero flat action.
  This removes per-channel phase fitting. It also records the limitation:
  physical CP requires selected nonzero C6 support matrices and noncommuting
  interference with other blocks; C6 amplitudes and Yukawa magnitudes remain
  open.

iwasawa_c6_support_noncommutation_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_c6_support_noncommutation_gate.py. It decomposes
  the leading heavy-link mismatch as Delta_v=Delta_t+chi_q Delta_c, where
  Delta_c is the up/down selected C6 support mismatch. Thus selected C6 support
  affects the leading CKM noncommutation gate only if Delta_c != (0,0), while
  full CP still requires nondegenerate spectra and Im det([H_u,H_d]) != 0. The
  current package contains no selected C6 support matrices or amplitudes.

ckm_heavy_link_gate_calculator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/compute_ckm_heavy_link_gate.py and the packet template
  selected_ckm_heavy_link_packet.template.json. The template requires the
  eight selected entries t_u13,t_u23,t_d13,t_d23,c_u13,c_u23,c_d13,c_d23 and
  the calculator computes Delta_v=Delta_t+chi_q Delta_c plus the leading
  noncommutation pass/fail result. The current template remains open and
  deliberately refuses all-null data.

ckm_heavy_link_packet_fill_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_fill_ckm_heavy_link_packet.py and the blocked packet
  selected_ckm_heavy_link_packet.attempt.json. The attempt scans the current
  proof package plus the local MTT corpus for the eight heavy-link entries. It
  finds 24 missing selected C1 primitive matrices, no selected C6 support
  files, no direct external entry-token hits, and therefore no selected
  Delta_v value yet.

qutrit_c6_pure_heavy_link_support_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_qutrit_c6_pure_heavy_link_support.py. It computes the
  finite invariant support matrices for the block-factorized qutrit conjugate
  pairings 1+2 and 2+1. Both are diagonal identity supports, so pure finite C6
  contributes no (1,3) or (2,3) heavy links and gives Delta_c=(0,0). This
  retires the C6-only leading-heavy-link route while leaving selected
  differential response, basis transport, or a stronger selected support
  operator open.

c1_heavy_link_delta_t_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/compute_c1_heavy_link_delta_t.py and the reduced packet template
  selected_c1_heavy_link_primitives.template.json. Because pure C6 gives
  Delta_c=(0,0), the leading CKM target can be attacked through
  Delta_t=t_d-t_u. This calculator needs only 24 selected scalar heavy-link
  primitive entries across the u/d sectors and six C1 terms, rather than full
  3x3 primitive matrices.

su5_qutrit_basis_transport_heavy_link_candidate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_su5_qutrit_basis_transport_heavy_links.py and
  candidate_data/su5_qutrit_basis_transport_heavy_link.candidate.json. Common
  Fourier transport cancels as gauge, but the E6/SU(5) split between
  10_M x 10_M and 10_M x bar5_M gives an exact nonzero candidate
  Delta_t=(1/sqrt(3), omega^2/sqrt(3)) if selected zero-mode data prove
  B_10=I_3 and B_bar5=F. This is a candidate C1 basis_connection fill, not
  selected MTT data or full SM closure.

su5_qutrit_transport_selector_hunt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/hunt_su5_qutrit_transport_selector.py. Excluding the new
  candidate files, it finds the SU(5) split, qutrit clock/shift machinery,
  Fourier common-gauge guardrail, and zero-mode/monad routes separately, but
  no direct selected theorem deriving B_10=I_3, B_bar5=F. The candidate
  therefore remains conditional on the next sector-transport selection lemma.

qutrit_polarization_transport_lemma_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_qutrit_polarization_transport_lemma.py. It proves the
  finite algebraic core: in the qutrit Heisenberg carrier, F^dagger Z F=X and
  F^dagger X F=Z^-1, and the dephased third-root Hadamard transports are only
  F and F^*. Thus the SU(5) heavy-link numbers follow once 10_M is selected in
  the clock polarization and bar5_M in the shift polarization. That geometric
  polarization selection remains open.

su5_qutrit_polarization_selection_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_su5_qutrit_polarization_selection_gate.py and
  selected_su5_qutrit_polarization_data.template.json. It closes the current
  rigor gate: selected U_10,U_bar5 basis data are still absent, and the
  tempting SU(3) wedge2(E) ~= E^* shortcut gives monomial dual transport, not
  the dense qutrit Fourier matrix. The heavy-link candidate therefore remains
  conditional until the selected sector-basis packet is filled.

selected_su5_qutrit_polarization_validator_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_selected_su5_qutrit_polarization.py and an explicitly
  unselected fixture packet. The validator refuses the open template, checks
  U_10/U_bar5 metric unitarity, qutrit clock/shift relations, sector
  polarizations, and relative Fourier transport modulo rephasing/permutation.
  The fixture U_10=I_3, U_bar5=F passes only as UNSELECTED_FIXTURE, so actual
  selected zero-mode source data remain required.

selected_su5_qutrit_polarization_packet_fill_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_fill_selected_su5_qutrit_polarization_packet.py and
  selected_su5_qutrit_polarization_data.attempt.json. The strongest current
  block-factorized qutrit/twisted route fills U_10=I_3 and U_bar5=F and passes
  the finite validator with orientation F, but the packet remains
  UNSELECTED_FIXTURE because selected gerbe source promotion, sector
  projectors, and zero-mode bases are still open.

visible_rank2_l2_pullback_cech_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_visible_rank2_l2_pullback_cech_attempt.py and
  visible_rank2_l2_pullback_cech_attempt.cohomology.json. The base-torus
  pullback candidate realizes c1(L^2)=(2,-4,0), has c1^2=-16 alpha_1, and
  gives reduced h1=8 by the elliptic Kunneth calculation. The packet passes
  the finite H^1/Ext validator, but only as UNSELECTED_FIXTURE: MTT selection
  of this pullback representative, raw transition data, stability, HYM/Route-C,
  and same-source operator data remain open.

visible_rank2_l2_pullback_selection_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_visible_rank2_l2_pullback_selection_attempt.py. It proves
  the relative selection theorem: the unchanged h1=8 cochain matrices promote
  to a non-split V_alpha input as soon as selected-source metadata is supplied.
  The unconditional MTT selection theorem remains open because no audited source
  currently selects the base-pullback L^2 representative, raw automorphy data,
  or the no-extra-flat/torsion-twist rule.

visible_rank2_l2_source_ambiguity_classification_certificate.json
  adds scripts/classify_visible_rank2_l2_source_ambiguity.py. It proves that
  c2=4 alpha_1 forces zero central degree but leaves four integral pullback
  L branches, all with reduced h1=8. It also records that flat Pic0 characters
  are invisible to the current c1/h1 checks, so branch orientation and
  flat/torsion character choice must come from selected source data rather than
  from a hidden convention.

visible_rank2_l2_branch_selection_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/reduce_visible_rank2_l2_branch_selection.py. It evaluates the
  available selectors one by one: c2, h1, slope chamber, q79/F orientation,
  S3 twisted orientation, alpha_1 flux support, and flat-character data. The
  result is a reduction rather than closure: a strict slope chamber leaves two
  branches, a symmetric shared-base chamber leaves (-2,1,0) and (1,-2,0), and
  no audited certificate maps q79/F to the ordered visible L branch.

selected_pullback_l2_branch_orientation_source_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/build_selected_pullback_l2_branch_orientation_source_gate.py.
  It proves the finite q79/F,m=1 qutrit table cannot distinguish L=(1,-2,0)
  from the swapped branch L=(-2,1,0): both reduce to (1,1) in F_3^2 and have
  B1(L,L)=2/3. The next selector must therefore be a source-certified
  p1:p2=1:2 Gauduchon wall/chamber, an integral Cech/Deligne/automorphy lift,
  or a D_E/dotD source ordering the base factors.

selected_gauduchon_wall_radius_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_selected_gauduchon_wall_radius_gate.py. It derives the
  Iwasawa slope map from J=r1^2 a+r2^2 b+r3^2 c and proves that the target
  p1:p2=1:2 wall is the radius-ratio condition r1:r2=sqrt(2):1. Current
  audited source packets either specialize to r1=r2 or leave the Iwasawa shape
  ratio open, so the wall remains a live source target rather than a closed
  branch-selection theorem.

visible_rank2_l2_integral_lift_source_gap_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_rank2_l2_integral_lift_source_gap.py. It proves
  the finite q79/F,m=1 quotient cannot distinguish the target L=(1,-2,0) from
  the swapped L=(-2,1,0), even after passing to L^2 mod 3. The selected flat
  gerbe is not an ordinary integral c1 matrix: the target lift requires
  E(g1,g2)=2 and E(g3,g4)=-4, while the finite deck quotient kills g3,g4.
  The existing h1=8 pullback packet conditionally promotes as soon as such a
  selected ordered integral Cech/automorphy source certificate is supplied.

visible_rank2_l2_appell_humbert_automorphy_certificate.json
  adds scripts/construct_visible_rank2_l2_appell_humbert_automorphy.py. It
  constructs the normalized theta/Appell-Humbert multiplier on the standard
  Gaussian base torus for degrees (2,-4,0), checks the cocycle law modulo
  2*pi*i*Z, and realizes the ordered ordinary Chern matrix E(g1,g2)=2,
  E(g3,g4)=-4, E(g5,g6)=0. Because the pairings are even, the trivial
  semicharacter is mathematically allowed. This closes automorphy existence
  for the target representative, but not MTT selection of Gamma0, the target
  branch, the neutral Pic0 representative, or same-source D_E/dotD data.

visible_rank2_l2_selector_obstruction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_visible_rank2_l2_selector_obstruction.py. It proves a
  no-hidden-selector theorem: the current closed topology, h1, finite qutrit,
  and Appell-Humbert data cannot uniquely select L=(1,-2,0), because the target
  and swapped branches are related by base swap and have equal closed
  invariants. It also proves neutral Pic0 cannot be selected by current
  topology/cohomology/curvature data. The next proof must add a symmetry-
  breaking source: selected r1:r2=sqrt(2):1 wall, selected ordered
  Cech/automorphy/D_E source, or same-source D_E/dotD/Hessian data.

visible_rank2_l2_selected_radius_import_nogo_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_visible_rank2_l2_selected_radius_import_nogo.py. It
  imports the constants/no-knob selected internal radius and proves that this
  particular cross-repo source is equal-horizontal:
  (r1,r2,r3)=(R,R,r3(R)), hence p1:p2=1:1 in the visible slope problem. The
  symmetric chamber leaves L=(-2,1,0) and L=(1,-2,0) negative together, so the
  constants selected radius cannot supply the target wall r1:r2=sqrt(2):1.
  This complements rather than rejects the constants theorem; the live sources
  remain a genuinely non-equal wall, an ordered integral Cech/automorphy/D_E
  source, or same-source D_E/dotD/Hessian data.

visible_rank2_l2_ordered_source_promotion_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_visible_rank2_l2_ordered_source_packet.py and
  scripts/build_visible_rank2_l2_ordered_source_promotion_gate.py. The gate
  fixes the exact promotion packet for the ordered representative L=(1,-2,0),
  L^2=(2,-4,0), E(g1,g2)=2, E(g3,g4)=-4, E(g5,g6)=0. It correctly refuses the
  current Appell-Humbert packet as an UNSELECTED_FIXTURE until selected source
  status, selected lattice/base ordering, target-vs-swapped symmetry breaking,
  and Pic0 selection or quotienting are supplied.

iwasawa_monad_l2_branch_orientation_candidate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_iwasawa_monad_l2_branch_orientation_candidate.py. It
  scans the printed Iwasawa monad line table and finds the exact ordered
  branch clue L3-K2=(1,-2,0), hence 2(L3-K2)=(2,-4,0). This is stronger than
  the finite mod-3 quotient and not an equal-radius import, but the generated
  ordered-source packet remains an UNSELECTED_FIXTURE until the monad
  difference is proved to be a selected visible V_alpha source and Pic0 is
  selected or quotiented.

monad_difference_l2_source_sufficiency_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_monad_difference_l2_source_sufficiency.py. It proves the
  relative sufficiency theorem: if a future Selected_Monad_Difference_L2_Source
  theorem marks L3-K2 as selected and selects neutral Pic0, the strict
  ordered-source validator passes without changing the arithmetic target or
  using observed/benchmark flavor inputs. The actual selected-source theorem,
  stability/HYM, and same-source D_E/dotD data remain open.

selected_monad_difference_l2_source_proof_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_selected_monad_difference_l2_source_attempt.py. It proves
  the strongest currently available form of the missing theorem: inside the
  ordered terminal monad-difference lane L_i-K2, central-neutrality and the
  target c1(L^2)=(2,-4,0) force L3-K2 uniquely. This closes conditional
  uniqueness and imports the previous sufficiency theorem, but it honestly
  leaves MTT selection of that lane, neutral Pic0 selection/quotienting, typed
  transition/section data, Ext promotion, stability/HYM, and same-source
  D_E/dotD data open.

monad_difference_pic0_switch_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_monad_difference_pic0_switch_reduction.py. It imports the
  constants-repo Pic0/source switch table and independently replays the four
  local q79 cases: none, Pic0-only, source-only, and source+Pic0. Pic0-only and
  source-only each remain OPEN for the other switch, while both switches pass,
  proving the ordered-source gate is reduced to exactly two independent source
  obligations rather than another arithmetic or matrix target.

ordered_layer_pic0_quotient_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_ordered_layer_pic0_quotient.py. It proves a scoped Pic0
  quotient theorem for the ordered Chern/H1/ordinary-curvature layer using the
  MTT physical-quotient corpus and the closed Pic0-invariance obstruction. The
  Pic0-quotiented ordered-layer packet has no Pic0 validator open items, but
  source-lane selection remains open and same-source D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD must
  recheck Pic0 at the holonomy-sensitive operator layer.

ordered_layer_terminal_lane_selector_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/reduce_ordered_layer_to_terminal_lane_selector.py. It proves
  that after the ordered-layer Pic0 quotient, the only local ordered-source
  blocker is the terminal monad lane selector. A hypothetical
  Selected_Terminal_Monad_Lane_Source_Selector.v1 packet passes the strict
  validator, while the actual selector, typed Cech/Appell-Humbert source, Ext
  promotion, operator-layer Pic0 recheck, stability/HYM, and same-source
  D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD remain open.

central_circle_neutral_terminal_lane_filter_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_central_circle_neutral_terminal_lane_filter.py. It imports
  the central-circle/gauge corpus and proves the z=0 neutrality filter inside
  the terminal monad lane. The unique central-neutral terminal difference is
  L3-K2=(1,-2,0), with double (2,-4,0). This closes the central-neutrality
  subassumption only; the terminal-map source principle, physical base-order
  binding, typed transitions/rhoE, operator-layer Pic0 recheck, stability/HYM,
  and same-source D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green remain open.

terminal_map_source_principle_base_order_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_terminal_map_source_principle_base_order.py. It collects
  the now-closed central-neutrality filter, ordered-layer Pic0 quotient, and
  terminal-lane reduction, then proves the actual selector is still not closed.
  The literal monad-map route is blocked by missing typed sections/rhoE and by
  the c2=0 matter-monad versus c2=4 alpha1 visible-source role split. The
  remaining minimal packet is Selected_Terminal_Map_Base_Order_Source_Packet.v1:
  it must bind terminal-map source selection, physical base order, and typed
  transition/rhoE or same-source D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green data.

terminal_map_dual_extension_sign_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_terminal_map_dual_extension_sign.py. It proves the sign
  convention for the terminal g3 route: the printed Hom type is
  K2-L3=(-1,2,0), while the physical extension line in
  0 -> L -> V_alpha -> L^{-1} -> 0 is the dual L=L3-K2=(1,-2,0), so
  L^2=(2,-4,0) with the already constructed ordered Appell-Humbert/Cech
  matrix. It deliberately leaves the actual MTT terminal-source selector open.

terminal_g3_valpha_source_path_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/reduce_terminal_g3_valpha_source_path.py. It reconciles the
  older finite-qutrit/Gauduchon branch-orientation gates with the terminal g3
  dual-sign theorem. On the terminal-g3 path, the sqrt(2) Gauduchon wall is no
  longer the primary sign selector; it is reclassified as a stability/HYM
  chamber witness. The remaining object is one
  Selected_Terminal_G3_VAlpha_Source.v1 packet.

terminal_admissible_section_source_principle_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_terminal_admissible_section_source_principle.py. It
  formulates the missing selector as an explicit MTT admissible-section source
  principle synthesized from the corpus rules for representative selection,
  nil-survivor refinement stability, saturation minimality, and duality. Under
  that principle, the terminal lane plus shared-circle neutrality and visible
  c2 compatibility uniquely select g3/L3-K2. The generated ordered-source
  packet and selected h1=8 Ext packet both pass their validators. The theorem
  remains conditional on adopting/proving the principle and still leaves
  stability/HYM, same-source Chern-Weil/D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, operator-layer
  Pic0, primitive C1, and full SM closure open.

unconditional_selected_monad_difference_l2_source_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_unconditional_selected_monad_difference_l2_source.py.
  It attempts the full Selected_Monad_Difference_L2_Source theorem through seven
  routes: direct corpus selector, flux monad table, core Cech principle,
  minimality/reuse, Pic0 quotient/selection, and same-source operator/Hessian
  data, plus the constants/no-knob terminal-lane attempt. All current routes
  fail to supply both a source-lane selector and a Pic0 rule, so the theorem
  remains blocked, but the exact minimal new statements required for closure
  are now machine-recorded.

same_source_monad_gs_operator_fusion_gate_certificate.json
  adds scripts/build_same_source_monad_gs_operator_fusion_gate.py.  It proves
  the proof-discipline reduction after the unconditional monad attempt: the
  separately closed monad arithmetic, time-oriented m=1 gerbe representative,
  visible Green-Schwarz curvature row, and Route C smoke data cannot be
  stitched together as a selected-source proof.  The next closing object must
  be one SameSourceMonadGSOperatorFusionPacket.v1 binding ordered L3-K2, Pic0,
  the GS row, projector retention, D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, and primitive C1 data.

same_source_monad_gs_operator_fusion_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_same_source_monad_gs_operator_fusion_packet.py and
  scripts/attempt_same_source_monad_gs_operator_fusion_packet.py.  The attempt
  fills SameSourceMonadGSOperatorFusionPacket.v1 with the current monad,
  gerbe/Green-Schwarz, and selected-source-promotion artifacts, then refuses to
  promote it as proof.  The validator reports OPEN with 20 concrete missing
  source/operator/Pic0 fields, no failures, and no observed flavor inputs or
  forbidden shortcuts.

selected_qa_su3_visible_source_architecture_import_certificate.json
  adds scripts/import_selected_qa_su3_visible_source_architecture.py.  It
  imports the constants/no-knob architecture ranking into this q79 repo:
  V_alpha/terminal monad is the primary skeleton, selected S3/Green-Schwarz
  support is the required same-source merge, and HYM/Route C is the execution
  engine.  It writes the local OPEN template
  selected_qa_su3_same_source_valpha_s3_operator_packet.template.json and
  confirms the GR stress-response update is not an SM-source substitute.

selected_qa_su3_same_source_valpha_s3_operator_packet_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_selected_qa_su3_same_source_valpha_s3_operator_packet.py
  and scripts/attempt_selected_qa_su3_same_source_valpha_s3_operator_packet.py.
  The attempt consumes the closed selected S3 class/restriction packet and the
  rank-two V_alpha target arithmetic, but stays OPEN because L3-K2 source
  selection, Pic0, nonzero Ext/stability, same-source Chern-Weil derivation,
  D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, and primitive C1 are still absent.

valpha_s3_mod3_cocycle_compatibility_certificate.json
  adds scripts/compute_valpha_s3_mod3_cocycle_compatibility.py.  It proves a
  finite quotient compatibility lemma: the selected S3 pullback table is
  bilinear over F3^2, its commutator is nondegenerate, and it is GL(2,F3)
  equivalent to each mod-3 V_alpha Appell-Humbert block.  The certificate keeps
  the result finite-only: it does not select the integral source, base order,
  Pic0, same-source binding, or operator data.

valpha_s3_full_mod3_pullback_obstruction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/compute_valpha_s3_full_mod3_pullback_obstruction.py.  It proves
  the companion obstruction: a single selected S3 F3^2 active quotient cannot
  pull back to the full four-generator V_alpha mod-3 form.  The rank bound is
  2 while V_alpha has rank 4, and an exhaustive check of all 6561 linear maps
  finds zero matches.  This preserves blockwise compatibility but prevents
  promoting one S3 quotient into the whole integral V_alpha source.

valpha_s3_two_block_mod3_lift_certificate.json
  adds scripts/compute_valpha_s3_two_block_mod3_lift.py.  It proves the sharp
  finite repair to the one-block obstruction: two independent S3-active blocks,
  transformed by the existing GL(2,F3) block map, exactly recover the full
  four-generator V_alpha mod-3 form.  This identifies the finite source shape
  required next, while leaving MTT selection, Pic0, same-source binding, and
  operator data open.

valpha_s3_two_block_source_selector_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_valpha_s3_two_block_source_selector_reduction.py.  It
  proves that the ordered integral L2=(2,-4,0) Appell-Humbert matrix reduces
  mod 3 to exactly the two-block finite V_alpha/S3 shape, while the current
  selected S3 deck quotient maps only g1,g2 into the active F3^2 quotient and
  kills g3,g4.  The remaining proof is therefore a symmetry-breaking source
  selector, not finite compatibility, ordinary automorphy existence, or h1
  arithmetic.

valpha_s3_symmetry_breaking_route_triage_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_valpha_s3_symmetry_breaking_route_triage.py and the open
  template selected_qa_su3_orientation_carrying_de_dotd_source.template.json.
  It ranks selected orientation-carrying D_E/dotD as the primary live route,
  because it can in principle select one m=1/m=2 branch and order the visible
  L2 target while feeding the existing finite D_E/dotD validators.  It also
  records that the equal-radius import is not the target wall and that no
  selected D_E/dotD source has yet been constructed.

selected_qa_su3_orientation_dedotd_source_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_selected_qa_su3_orientation_dedotd_source_packet.py and
  scripts/attempt_selected_qa_su3_orientation_dedotd_source_packet.py.  The
  attempt wires the current q79 branch-smoke D_E, reduced-Green, and dotD
  packets into the new orientation-carrying source gate and checks the q369
  conjugate branch in parallel.  Both branches reach the finite validator layer
  and are refused at selected-source / alpha1-driver flags, so the blocker is
  now isolated as source origin and same-branch alpha1-driver proof.

orientation_branch_antiunitary_equivalence_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_orientation_branch_antiunitary_equivalence.py.  It proves
  the current q79 and q369 branch-smoke D_E, reduced-Green, and dotD packets
  are finite antiunitary conjugates across 1629 compared entries, with maximum
  conjugation error 1.24e-16.  This closes the finite branch-pair matrix
  comparison while preserving the open source-selection theorem: the same 28
  source flags remain false on both branches.

orientation_observable_parity_certificate.json
  adds scripts/derive_orientation_observable_parity.py.  It derives the finite
  parity consequences of the antiunitary pair: 133/133 CP-even norm checks pass
  exactly, 329/329 complex-conjugation checks pass with maximum error about
  1.67e-16, and 21 nonzero imaginary diagnostics flip sign.  It records the
  guarded conditional rule that antiunitary-conjugate future Yukawa packets
  have equal singular values, mass ratios, and CKM angle magnitudes, while
  Jarlskog-type CP-odd signs reverse.

constants_m1_cw_source_route_import_certificate.json
  adds scripts/import_constants_m1_cw_source_route.py.  It imports the latest
  constants-repo m1 Chern-Weil/operator-source route and proves it targets the
  same non-split rank-two V_alpha extension already used by q79: L=(1,-2,0),
  L2=(2,-4,0), and c2=4 alpha_1.  It also proves the existing q79 h1=8 packet
  is compatible with the constants H1 template and would promote after a
  selected source certificate, while preserving source/stability/D_E-dotD/C1
  as open.

valpha_operator_source_critical_path_certificate.json
  adds scripts/reduce_valpha_operator_source_critical_path.py.  It proves the
  remaining V_alpha/S3/DEDotD frontier is concentrated in one source packet:
  Selected_VAlpha_ChernWeil_Operator_Source.v1.  H1 arithmetic, selected S3
  class/Freed-Witten/block projectors, visible GS curvature, two-block mod-3
  shape, and finite q79/q369 matrix shape are retired as independent blockers;
  selected V_alpha source, Pic0, stability, same-source Chern-Weil derivation,
  D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, primitive C1, and full SM closure remain open.

selected_valpha_chern_weil_operator_source_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/validate_selected_valpha_chern_weil_operator_source.py and
  scripts/attempt_selected_valpha_chern_weil_operator_source.py.  This makes
  Selected_VAlpha_ChernWeil_Operator_Source.v1 executable.  The current attempt
  consumes the closed q79 target, selected S3 class/restriction, visible GS
  curvature, antiunitary branch pair, and CP-even parity data, while correctly
  refusing promotion until V_alpha source selection, Pic0, Ext/stability,
  same-source Chern-Weil derivation, D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, and primitive C1
  data are supplied.

selected_valpha_operator_source_sufficiency_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_selected_valpha_operator_source_sufficiency.py.  It proves
  that hypothetical selected copies of the ordered L3-K2 source, visible
  Green-Schwarz source, and Route-C operator-origin packets make the complete
  Selected_VAlpha_ChernWeil_Operator_Source.v1 validator pass.  This retires
  hidden downstream finite-matrix defects as a blocker while preserving the
  actual selected source certificate, Pic0, Ext/stability, same-source
  Chern-Weil derivation, selected D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, primitive C1, and full
  SM closure as open.

terminal_valpha_remaining_parts_lockdown_certificate.json
  adds scripts/lock_terminal_valpha_remaining_parts.py.  It freezes the current
  frontier after the terminal admissible-section source result: L3-K2,
  ordered L2=(2,-4,0), h1=8, and a selected nonzero Ext vector are closed under
  the explicit principle, the split abelian HYM shortcut is retired, and
  downstream validator plumbing is not the blocker.  The exact remaining gates
  are the unconditional section theorem, non-split stability/HYM or Route-C,
  operator-layer Pic0, same-source Chern-Weil/GS and D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD,
  primitive C1 contractions, and no-proxy SM closure.

all_remaining_valpha_gates_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_all_remaining_valpha_gates.py.  It executes all seven
  remaining V_alpha gates after lockdown and generates after-lockdown operator
  packets that consume the selected terminal ordered source and h1=8/nonzero
  Ext packet.  The ordered-source subvalidators now pass in both generated
  operator packets; the remaining open failures are the genuine selected-source
  obligations: unconditional section promotion, stability/HYM or Route-C,
  operator-layer Pic0, same-source Chern-Weil/GS, same-source
  D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, 24 primitive C1 contractions, and no-proxy SM data.

valpha_extension_stability_filter_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_valpha_extension_stability_filter.py.  It applies the
  selected h1=8/nonzero Ext packet to the rank-two extension stability wall:
  at p=(1,2,1), L=(1,-2,0) has slope -3 and the quotient class L^-1=(-1,2,0)
  has slope +3, but L^-1 is excluded as a subline because it would split the
  nonzero selected extension.  The finite branch-candidate filter leaves only
  the zero-slope classes (-2,1,0) and (2,-1,0), plus the larger open theorem
  that this finite list really exhausts destabilizing rank-one subsheaves.  It
  creates candidate_data/valpha_extension_stability_filter/destabilizer_yoneda_obstruction.template.json
  for the missing Hom/Yoneda pullback matrices and does not claim full
  stability, HYM existence, or full SM closure.

valpha_zero_slope_yoneda_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_valpha_zero_slope_yoneda_reduction.py.  It applies the
  exact sequence 0 -> Hom(M,L) -> Hom(M,V_alpha) -> Hom(M,L^-1) -> Ext^1(M,L)
  to the two zero-slope branch candidates in the reduced base-pullback
  Cech/Kunneth model.  The class M=(2,-1,0) is excluded in that model because
  both Hom(M,L) and Hom(M,L^-1) vanish.  The class M=(-2,1,0) is reduced to a
  single remaining Yoneda boundary scalar
  candidate_data/valpha_zero_slope_yoneda/remaining_yoneda_scalar.template.json.
  Full stability remains open until that scalar is proved nonzero and a
  complete destabilizing-subsheaf enumeration or finite reduction theorem is
  supplied.

valpha_remaining_yoneda_scalar_attempt_certificate.json
  adds scripts/attempt_valpha_remaining_yoneda_scalar.py.  It evaluates the
  last finite branch-candidate scalar in the canonical theta-ladder model:
  H^0(1,1,0) sends the selected Ext basis vector
  theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_0 in H^1(2,-4,0) to the nonzero target
  component theta_plus3_0_tensor_eta_minus3_0 in H^1(3,-3,0).  This is a
  candidate closure of the remaining finite zero-slope branch, but it remains
  selection-open until raw Appell-Humbert/Cech multiplication data or an MTT
  theorem selects the canonical theta-ladder basis.

valpha_kunneth_yoneda_scalar_proof_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_valpha_kunneth_yoneda_scalar.py.  It proves the previous
  canonical theta-ladder map is the reduced Kunneth/Serre-duality
  multiplication matrix: the positive factor H^0(O(2))->H^0(O(3)) has rank 2,
  the negative Serre-dual factor H^1(O(-4))->H^1(O(-3)) has rank 3, and their
  9x8 Kronecker product maps the selected Ext vector to a nonzero target
  vector.  This closes the remaining finite branch-candidate Yoneda scalar in
  the selected reduced Kunneth model, while full stability remains open pending
  complete destabilizing-subsheaf enumeration and, if demanded, raw good-cover
  Appell-Humbert/Cech multiplication.

valpha_central_neutral_destabilizer_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_valpha_central_neutral_destabilizer_reduction.py.  It
  proves the complete central-neutral base-pullback line-bundle destabilizer
  reduction in the selected reduced Kunneth model: Hom(M,L) has no
  nonnegative-slope hits, Hom(M,L^-1) gives exactly six candidates, and the
  selected extension boundary is injective on all six Hom spaces.  The sweep
  records that four extra Hom-destabilizer candidates appear beyond the older
  finite branch/topology list, then kills those rows by explicit reduced
  Kunneth boundary matrices.  Full V_alpha stability still requires a source
  theorem reducing all rank-one torsion-free destabilizers to this
  central-neutral lane, or a direct raw good-cover/HYM replacement.

valpha_appell_humbert_yoneda_promotion_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_valpha_appell_humbert_yoneda_promotion.py.  It proves
  that, for the neutral standard Gaussian Appell-Humbert representative, the
  reduced Kunneth/Yoneda boundary maps are exactly factor-of-automorphy
  multiplication by degree addition: (Q-M)+(2,-4,0)=L-M for all six
  central-neutral candidates.  This promotes the multiplication law to
  Appell-Humbert automorphy conditional on source selection.  It still does
  not select the Appell-Humbert representative, choose/quotient Pic0, provide
  literal finite good-cover transitions, prove HYM existence, or close SM data.

valpha_repo_update_source_frontier_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_valpha_repo_update_source_frontier.py.  It checks the
  local q79, constants, GR, Qa/SU3 packet, and SM-parity repos, records moving
  adjacent repo heads, and treats any dirty adjacent packet set as provisional
  frontier information rather than proof data.  The resulting q79-safe
  reduction is that the next source-selection bridge runs through
  orientation-carrying D_E/dotD, selected source origin plus alpha1 driver, and
  finite emission morphism Phi_fin.
  Selected Pic0, visible source, global stability, HYM/Route-C values, and SM
  closure remain open.

q79_valpha_source_origin_finite_emission_bridge_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_valpha_source_origin_finite_emission_bridge.py.  It
  makes the repo-update frontier q79-local by proving the finite Route-C
  codomain shape that a selected Phi_fin alpha1 payload must fill.  The current
  q79/F,m=1 packet passes the finite shape gates but is rejected as selected
  proof because its source flags are false and rho_E is identity smoke.  The
  bridge also ties the alpha1 C1-response blocker to the same selected payload,
  while keeping dirty SM-parity packets as status evidence only.

q79_selected_phifin_alpha1_payload_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_selected_phifin_alpha1_payload.py.  It closes the
  current decision gate for the selected Phi_fin alpha1 payload attempt:
  finite codomain and alpha1 support pass, but selected emission remains open.
  The latest constants, QA/SU3, GR, and SM-parity certificates sharpen the
  blocker past diagnostic splitters and into selected C1 operator source,
  A_selected/b_selected emission, and non-invariant C1 primitive or basis
  transport.  The adjacent nonidentity rhoE/27-mode BN prefix is imported as
  an unselected finite prefix; its canonical C1 response is zero, so it is not
  a payload proof.  The latest rebuild/status imports select the
  basis-transport or vertex/primitive source theorem as the next proof target.

q79_routec_basis_transport_primitive_source_theorem_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_routec_basis_transport_primitive_source_theorem.py.
  It closes the primitive-only basis-transport target as a counterexample:
  neither the fixed-fiber primitive span nor the fixed-plus-all-fiber envelope
  contains the locked 72-dimensional qutrit/Weyl splitter target.  It also
  imports the enriched Weyl-pair gate, where phase and shift packets reconstruct
  the locked splitter to numerical tolerance, while preserving same-branch
  source provenance, A_selected, b_selected, and full SM closure as open.  The
  next proof target is theorem-derived Weyl-pair A_selected assembly or source
  proof.

q79_routec_weylpair_aselected_assembly_or_source_proof_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_routec_weylpair_aselected_assembly_or_source_proof.py.
  It imports the conditional Weyl-pair A assembly: the phase and shift columns
  form a 72x2 operator of rank 2 and solve the locked DeltaTheta_C1 splitter
  equation with residual below 1e-12.  This closes the remaining algebraic
  assembly obstruction but deliberately does not promote the conditional
  operator to A_selected, does not emit b_selected, and does not claim full SM
  closure.  The next proof target is the selected Weyl-pair source provenance
  lemma.

q79_routec_weylpair_source_provenance_lemma_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_routec_weylpair_source_provenance_lemma.py.  It
  proves the sourced part of the Weyl-pair provenance problem: the selected
  S3/Green-Schwarz q79/F,m=1 source-level carrier supplies g1=Z, g2=X, and
  active shift (1,1), and the source-to-C1 transfer is exact conditionally.
  It also proves why full promotion is not yet legal: the only current route
  selecting u/e<-Z and d/nuD<-X is the locked target-column match, while no
  independent sector-charge/chirality certificate or selected Phi_fin/B_N
  primitive emission exists.  The next proof target is the selected Weyl-pair
  sector-charge or chirality certificate.

q79_routec_weylpair_sector_charge_or_chirality_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_routec_weylpair_sector_charge_or_chirality_certificate.py.
  It imports the q79 SU(5)/E6 and latest SM-parity Route-C packets to test
  whether the sector selector is already selected.  The result is a proved
  reduction, not closure: the SU(5)/E6 dictionary gives the intended structural
  split 10_M={u,e} versus non-10/singlet={d,nuD}, and the conditional C1 route
  is exact, but the selected 1_M Dirac-neutrino shift rule, same-source
  matter-slot charge theorem, overlap/transfer functor, and normalization
  theorem remain open.  The next proof target is the selected matter-slot
  charge and overlap-normalization theorem.

q79_selected_matter_slot_charge_and_overlap_normalization_theorem_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_selected_matter_slot_charge_and_overlap_normalization_theorem.py.
  It imports the latest SM-parity theorem attempt and same-source operator
  packet contract.  The selected matter-slot charge and overlap-normalization
  theorem is reduced, not closed: finite SU(5) transversality, source-level
  qutrit Weyl support, conditional routing, and conditional normalization are
  present, but the required same-source packet has seven required fields,
  six support-level fields, and zero selected-emitted fields.  The next proof
  target is a fill-or-no-go theorem for that same-source operator packet.

q79_samesource_operatorpacket_fill_or_nogo_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_samesource_operatorpacket_fill_or_nogo.py.  It
  imports the actual SM-parity seven-field fill attempt and records a
  validator-backed no-go for current scaffolds: six fields have support, zero
  fields are selected-emitted, and neither A_selected nor b_selected is
  promoted.  It also imports the downstream frontier: the source-emission plan,
  operator-source identity reduction, and rank-two L2/Ext arithmetic fill have
  advanced the wall to non-split stability/HYM or an honest selected Route-C
  residual source, plus operator-layer Pic0, same-source Chern-Weil/GS,
  D_E/rho_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, primitive C1 contractions, and no-proxy SM data.

q79_stability_hym_or_routec_residual_source_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_stability_hym_or_routec_residual_source.py.  It
  imports the stability/HYM attempt and proves the q79 central-neutral
  destabilizer subtheorem: for V_alpha with L=(1,-2,0), selected nonzero Ext
  class, and p=(1,2,1), all six central-neutral base-pullback rank-one
  destabilizer candidates are obstructed by injective reduced Yoneda
  boundaries.  It does not claim full stability, HYM existence, selected
  Route-C residual values, A_selected, b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_global_destabilizer_enumeration_or_selected_residual_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_global_destabilizer_enumeration_or_selected_residual.py.
  It proves the unbounded reduced Appell-Humbert rank-one line enumeration:
  Hom(M,L) has no nonnegative-slope candidates and Hom(M,L^-1) gives exactly
  the six central-neutral classes already killed by the Yoneda boundary maps.
  Thus V_alpha is stable inside the reduced AH rank-one line model.  The
  remaining promotion gap is selected AH or literal good-cover/Cech data,
  rank-one torsion-free reflexive hull representation, selected Gauduchon/HYM
  existence, or selected Route-C residual values.

q79_selected_ah_goodcover_promotion_hym_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_selected_ah_goodcover_promotion_hym_certificate.py.
  It proves the standard saturated rank-one torsion-free/reflexive-hull
  reduction: any destabilizing rank-one torsion-free subsheaf may be replaced
  by a saturated reflexive line-hull destabilizer, hence by a line-bundle class
  once the selected AH or literal good-cover/Cech section algebra is supplied.
  It also records the conditional Li-Yau/Gauduchon HYM bridge.  Full HYM is not
  claimed: selected AH/good-cover source data, neutral Pic0 or quotient,
  selected target branch, selected Gauduchon chamber, HYM/Route-C values,
  D_E/rho_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, primitive C1 contractions, and full SM closure
  remain open.

q79_ah_source_selection_or_routec_residual_reduction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_ah_source_selection_or_routec_residual_reduction.py.
  It proves that AH automorphy and literal good-cover/Cech transition data are
  equivalent representatives of the same selected line-bundle/source class
  once the source is selected, so good-cover data are no longer an independent
  physical knob.  The remaining source target is reduced to selected terminal
  monad lane L3-K2 bound to AH/Cech transitions with selected lattice/base
  order plus operator-layer Pic0 recheck, or else an honest selected Route-C
  residual/HYM operator source.  Current Route-C residual validators still fail
  selected_source_verified, so no full HYM or SM closure is claimed.

q79_selected_monad_l2_source_and_operatorpic0_or_routec_residual_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_selected_monad_l2_source_and_operatorpic0_or_routec_residual.py.
  It closes the selected monad-difference L2 source lane under the explicit
  TerminalAdmissibleSectionSourcePrinciple.v1: the strict ordered-source
  validator accepts g3/L3-K2 with L=(1,-2,0), L^2=(2,-4,0), and the selected
  h1=8 cohomology packet promotes a nonzero closed non-exact Ext vector as
  non-split V_alpha input.  It also runs a clearly marked selected-flags-only
  diagnostic for the Route-C finite operator packets: changing only provenance
  flags makes the residual and selected-source promotion validators pass, so
  the current finite residual wall is selected-source provenance rather than
  numerical residual arithmetic.  It does not claim operator-layer Pic0,
  selected Route-C residual, HYM, A_selected, b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_same_source_operator_provenance_or_selected_routec_solve_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_same_source_operator_provenance_or_selected_routec_solve.py.
  It tries the same-source operator theorem and proves the current patchwork
  no-go: the honest packet now has a passing selected ordered-source
  subvalidator, but it is still rejected because a single selected source does
  not yet bind source identity, visible Green-Schwarz provenance,
  D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD provenance, and primitive C1 contractions.  Diagnostics
  show that genuine same-source operator provenance would reduce the validator
  to primitive C1 only, and that full supplied provenance plus primitive C1 has
  no hidden validator obstruction.  Those diagnostics are not selected-source
  proofs and do not claim selected Route-C residual, HYM, A_selected,
  b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_selected_visible_bundle_operator_source_or_primitive_c1_contractions_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_selected_visible_bundle_operator_source_or_primitive_c1_contractions.py.
  It creates the next executable two-lane target.  Lane A is a latest-current
  Selected_VAlpha_ChernWeil_Operator_Source packet that consumes the selected
  monad L^2 and h1=8 Ext input; its ordered-source and S3 subvalidators pass,
  but selected source identity, non-split stability/HYM or Route-C solve,
  same-source Green-Schwarz, D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, orientation-by-source, and
  primitive C1 remain open.  Lane B enumerates primitive C1 as 24 selected
  same-source 3x3 matrices, not a scalar.  The C1 calculator refuses the
  incomplete template, and the missing-data scan still reports
  selected_operator_source as the first blocking layer.

q79_selected_de_green_dotd_source_for_primitive_c1_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_selected_de_green_dotd_source_for_primitive_c1.py.
  It creates the selected D_E/Green/dotD source gate for primitive C1.  The
  honest current Route-C residual, D_E, Riesz, reduced-Green, dotD, and
  promotion validators are all executed and all fail because selected-source
  provenance is absent.  The selected-flags-only diagnostic stack passes those
  same validators, so the current wall is a selected source certificate or typed
  D_E construction, not hidden finite arithmetic.  It maps primitive C1 to 24
  same-source 3x3 atoms with sector slots u=(Q,u,H), d=(Q,d,H), e=(L,e,H), and
  nuD=(L,N,H).  It is a gate theorem only: it does not claim selected Route-C
  residual, HYM, primitive C1 values, selected C1 response matrices, A_selected,
  b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_routec_selected_source_certificate_or_typed_de_construction_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_routec_selected_source_certificate_or_typed_de_construction.py.
  It creates the missing selected connection witness target.  The honest
  selected Route-C/HYM operator-source packet is tested and still fails.  The
  typed D_E construction route remains blocked by missing typed monad/Cech
  sections or selected HYM connection coefficients.  A selected-flags-only
  diagnostic packet passes the selected-HYM/operator-source validator, showing
  the validator plumbing is not the wall.  The new witness contract specifies
  the honest data now required: either a selected Route-C source certificate,
  typed monad/Cech D_E data, or a direct selected HYM connection with residual
  bounds.  It does not claim selected D_E, dotD, Riesz/Green, primitive C1,
  A_selected, b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_typed_monad_cech_or_hym_connection_witness_certificate.json
  adds scripts/analyze_q79_typed_monad_cech_or_hym_connection_witness.py.
  It attempts to construct the selected typed monad/Cech or HYM connection
  witness from the current corpus and records the strict result: the witness
  values are absent.  The generic constant maps phrase is rejected because the
  current Hom c1 checks make nonzero scalar entries not globally typed without
  explicit sections or transition data.  The identity-rho Route-C smoke packet
  has zero finite residuals and positive gates, but selected_source_verified is
  false and the packet cannot be promoted to selected source data.  The artifact
  creates the minimal actual witness payload required next: either typed
  monad/Cech maps with transitions, g o f = 0, and exactness; direct selected
  HYM connection coefficients with residual bounds; or a selected finite
  Route-C solve with non-identity selected rho_E and a positive selection
  certificate.  It does not claim selected D_E, primitive C1, A_selected,
  b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_selected_finite_connection_solve_execution_certificate.json
  adds scripts/execute_q79_selected_finite_connection_solve.py.  It executes
  the selected finite connection solve target as far as current finite values
  permit.  Identity-rho smoke is superseded by a nonidentity projective rho_E
  candidate, a smooth 27-mode B_N basis, model-active D_E/Riesz/Green values,
  sector projectors, dotD_alpha1, a canonical C1 contraction engine, and a
  first tracefree HYM correction imported from the adjacent constants/SM/GR
  chains.  The result is still not selected source closure: rho_E is not
  selected_by_mtt, diagnostic replay still depends on source flags, canonical
  C1 response is zero, and full selected HYM/Strominger operator provenance and
  truncation bounds remain open.  The new contract points to selected trace
  equality, full HYM Newton replay, or typed monad/Cech payload as the next
  honest closing routes.  It does not claim selected primitive C1 values,
  A_selected, b_selected, or full SM closure.

q79_selected_trace_equals_emitted_27mode_operator_or_full_hym_newton_replay_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_q79_selected_trace_equals_emitted_27mode_operator_or_full_hym_newton_replay.py.
  It imports the adjacent selected canonical trace formula source lemma and
  selected Phi_fin S2 gap-layer lock, then proves the selected trace equality
  for the emitted 27-mode D_E operator on the q79/F,m=1 branch.  The selected
  source induces the canonical active F3xF3 Fourier metric, projective-flat
  connection, and H-sector rank-two zero-cluster projector on B_N, so the
  emitted 27-mode D_E formula equals Phi_fin(D_E(selected source)) sector by
  sector.  This locks the selected D_E gap/Riesz/Green layer with selected
  eta_N=1.0 below threshold and a positive gap/Green bound.  Scalar and
  diagonal expS HYM replay are recorded as supporting progress only; full
  connection lift and operator extraction remain open.  It does not claim
  dotD_alpha1, primitive C1 response, A_selected, b_selected, Yukawa
  magnitudes, or full SM closure.

q79_selected_dotd_alpha1_c1_response_emission_certificate.json
  adds scripts/prove_q79_selected_dotd_alpha1_c1_response_emission.py.  It
  imports the selected Phi_fin dotD/C1 response frontier and proves the exact
  reduction now needed after the D_E trace/gap theorem: same-basis nonzero
  dotD_alpha1 value matrices and clean sector projectors exist, but selected
  dotD is a first-variation claim and still requires an operator-level selected
  alpha1 tangent or retarded-overlap derivative source in the locked B_N basis.
  The artifact explicitly keeps selected_dotD_source_verified,
  alpha1_driver_verified, selected Hess_Xi blocks, zero-mode bases, primitive
  C1 contractions, sector response matrices, A_selected, b_selected, Yukawa
  magnitudes, and full SM closure open.

q79_theorem_change_list_for_paper_updates_certificate.json
  adds scripts/build_q79_theorem_change_list_for_paper_updates.py.  It is a
  theorem-only paper-update ledger: keep terminal q=79 exact/charge closure,
  downgrade the Weyl-pair A operator to conditional, replace the full
  source-provenance and sector-charge claims with reduction theorems, keep
  q79/q369 as time-oriented/conjugate branches with ordered SU(5) still open,
  reduce the matter-slot/overlap-normalization theorem to a same-source packet,
  replace the bulk same-source packet fill with the validator no-go/frontier
  update, record the central-neutral stability subtheorem, promote the frontier
  to reduced AH global enumeration, add the reflexive-hull/conditional HYM
  promotion bridge, replace literal good-cover search with source-class or
  selected-residual reduction, close the monad-difference L2 source under the
  explicit terminal section principle, replace same-source operator closure
  with the patchwork no-go/frontier theorem, create the visible-operator-or-
  primitive-C1 two-lane target, add the selected D_E/Green/dotD source gate,
  create the selected connection witness contract, record the typed
  monad/Cech-or-HYM witness construction attempt as values-absent, record the
  finite connection execution as finite values/source trace open, prove the
  selected 27-mode D_E trace equality and D_E gap/Riesz/Green layer while
  keeping dotD/C1 open, reduce dotD_alpha1/C1 response emission to the selected
  alpha1-tangent or retarded-overlap-kernel theorem, and keep full SM
  data/Yukawa/CKM magnitude closure open.  It records exact replacement
  statements and search patterns for updating narrative papers, now pointing
  the next theorem at the selected alpha1 tangent or retarded-overlap kernel.

## Optional Templates

The `*.template.json` files remain deliberately marked `OPEN`. They are not
blockers for the selected exact/charge branch. They are slots for stronger
future routes:

```text
z64_exact_block_certificate.template.json
  extract the same Z64 block from a larger non-exact mixed MTT Hessian before
  selecting the exact central-circle branch.

z7_fuyau_mukai_sector_certificate.template.json
  realize the determinant-seven Mukai pair by a single locally-free HYM bundle
  construction rather than fixed charge-sector data.

yukawa_overlap_kernel_certificate.template.json
  fix the matter curves, bundles, zero modes, finite overlap channels,
  holonomy characters, action costs, and kinetic normalizations before any
  mass or mixing comparison.

flavor_rg_matching_certificate.template.json
  fix the matching scale, scheme, thresholds, running equations, and
  experimental comparison convention before claiming fermion mass predictions.

selected_c1_primitive_contractions.template.json
  supply the primitive contraction matrices needed by the finite C1 response
  calculator.

iwasawa_typed_monad_maps.template.json
  supply the typed f_i and g_i section representatives, transition checks,
  g o f = 0, exactness/local-freeness, H^1(X,E) basis, sector projections,
  metrics/projectors/Green operators, and dotD_alpha1 operators required by
  the Iwasawa monad route.

iwasawa_selected_cohomology_data.template.json
  fill after either typed monad/Cech or non-invariant spectral Galerkin data
  are available. It is the upgrade template from net chirality to selected
  H^1(X,E) representatives and the dotD-ready sector data.

iwasawa_spectral_galerkin_data.template.json
  future fill-in slot for the triggered non-invariant spectral Galerkin branch:
  selected operator D_E, basis beyond left-invariant forms, low spectrum,
  Riesz projector, complement gap/error bound, Psi_i representatives, sector
  projections, dotD_alpha1, and reduced Green operator.

time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature.template.json
  future fill-in slot for the visible curvature equation on the selected
  q79/F,m=1 branch: curvature basis, dH, Tr R_+^2, Tr F_visible^2, and a zero
  residual certificate from a selected source.

time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_requirement_certificate.json
  records the derived one-row target for that template: the selected visible
  source must realize Tr F_visible^2=(8*r3^2/(r1^2*r2^2)+4*r3^2) alpha_1 in
  the invariant basis.

time_oriented_m1_visible_green_schwarz_curvature.selected.json
  selected symbolic fill of the visible Green-Schwarz curvature packet. It is
  closed at curvature level and explicitly marks the operator source as open.

time_oriented_m1_visible_gs_source.template.json
  future fill-in slot for the selected source that realizes that row. The
  validator rejects coefficient-only copies unless the packet also supplies
  selected visible bundle evidence, Chern-Weil derivation, and HYM/Route-C
  residual verification.

selected_su5_qutrit_polarization_data.template.json
  future fill-in slot for the exact SU(5) qutrit selector: selected U_10 and
  U_bar5 sector-basis matrices, their clock/shift polarization evidence,
  selected-source certificate, and the finite acceptance test
  U_10^dagger U_bar5 = F or F^* modulo rephasing/permutation.
