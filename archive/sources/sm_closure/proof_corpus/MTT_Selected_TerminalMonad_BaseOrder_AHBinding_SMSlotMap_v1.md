# MTT Selected TerminalMonad BaseOrder AHBinding SMSlotMap v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_TERMINALMONAD_BASEORDER_AHBINDING_SMSLOTMAP_GATE_BUILT_SOURCE_PROMOTION_OPEN`

This artifact checks whether the next gate can be closed from existing repo
data.  It cannot, but the failure is now sharply localized.

## Result

Existing artifacts provide strong constructed support:

- the ordered Appell-Humbert representative exists for `L^2=(2,-4,0)`;
- the AH/Yoneda multiplication law is verified;
- a diagnostic terminal-lockdown packet sets base order and standard lattice;
- q79 SU(5)/E6 support gives `U_10=I_3`, `U_bar5=F`, and the structural
  `1_M=N^c` Dirac-neutrino channel.

None of these is yet a selected theorem source.  The terminal-lockdown packet
is explicitly fixture-only and not selected by MTT; the AH representative is
constructed but not selected; the SM slot map is structurally supported but not
emitted as a selected section-ring/cohomology functor.

## Cutset Theorem

The next honest closure object is exactly a three-gate cutset:

- terminal map source principle plus selected base order;
- selected AH/Cech binding for the same `L3-K2` class;
- selected section-ring/cohomology functor to `10_M`, `bar5_M`, and `1_M`,
  including the `1_M` Dirac rule and overlap normalization.

Route-C remains a legal bypass only if it emits those same fields directly as
selected operator data.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_TerminalMap_SourcePrinciple_or_SMSlotFunctor_v1`.
