# q79 Shared-Circle SpinC Determinant Bridge v1

## Exact finite theorem

On the executed selected-side branch complement,

```text
H1(X;Z)=Z6.
```

Let `a:Z6->Z2` be the sheet-sign character and embed the unique order-two
group into the selected shared carrier by

```text
iota:Z2->Z64,  iota(1)=32.
```

Then

```text
h=iota o a:Z6->Z64,  h(mu)=32
```

is the unique nontrivial homomorphism from `Z6` to `Z64`. Indeed a generator
image `x` must obey `6x=0 mod 64`, whose only solutions are `0` and `32`.

The two weight-one roots of the TT character obey

```text
chi_1 o h = chi_33 o h = (-1)^a,
chi_2 o h = 1,
chi_32 o h = 1.
```

The first equality is exactly the determinant character of the signed-sheet
SpinC lift. Since flat Hermitian lines with flat unitary connection are
classified by their holonomy characters, for either root `r=1,33`,

```text
h^*L_r ~= L_det
```

as flat lines with connection.

## Why this matters

The determinant bridge is independent of the unresolved `chi_1/chi_33` choice.
Their quotient is invisible not only to TT weight two but also after restriction
to the unique central map. Thus quantum-gravity SpinC cancellation does not need
to choose between the two roots and adds no parameter.

This also explains the division of labor:

```text
weight one restricted to the central image -> determinant sign,
weight two restricted to the central image -> trivial.
```

Strict Spin remains obstructed; the shared-circle channel supplies the
determinant line of the SpinC repair instead.

## Remaining source boundary

The theorem constructs and uniquely characterizes the compatible central map.
It does not yet prove that the selected MTT action emits that map from the same
HYM source, identify the internal shared line with the external transverse
weight-one connection, or extend the carrier through ramification. The input
packet also retains `integral_branch_selected=false`.
