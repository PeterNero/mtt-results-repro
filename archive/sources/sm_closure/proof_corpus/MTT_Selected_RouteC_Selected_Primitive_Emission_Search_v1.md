# MTT Selected Route-C Selected Primitive Emission Search

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEC_PRIMITIVE_EMISSION_SEARCH_EXECUTED_NO_LEGAL_EMISSION_FOUND`

The strict search looked for legal selected primitive emissions already present
in the repo.

## Result

- `Phi_fin` selected payload: not emitted.
- `B_N` quotient/deck-valid basis payload: not emitted.
- selected S3 deck scaffold: present, but only as a partial execution scaffold.
- formal-lift algebra: useful diagnostic, not proof.

This closes the question of whether R1-R6 were blocked only by missing wiring.
They are not.  Existing artifacts supply support and validator shapes, but do
not emit the selected non-identity `rho_E`, metric/connection, operator action,
quadrature, non-invariant basis, gap certificate, or C1 response required for
honest replay.

## Next

Build `MTT_Selected_RouteC_NonIdentity_RhoE_and_BN_Construction_v1`: construct
the selected non-identity projective/twisted `rho_E` and quotient-valid
non-invariant Galerkin `B_N` from the same q79/F,m=1 branch.
