  We attempt to fill `IwasawaTwistedSourcePromotionPacket.v1` from the current
  projective qutrit magnetic carrier.  The fill succeeds for the finite
  arithmetic: the nontrivial F_3^2 finite-Heisenberg cocycle, period
  denominator three, central phase label, projective rho_E table, and Hermitian
  metric candidate are supplied.  The packet cannot be promoted.  The selected
  finite m=1 period table, deck/Cech lift, conditional flat gerbe promotion,
  finite DD(B) cycle-restriction gate, selected qutrit clock/shift line-cycle
  restrictions, Green-Schwarz preservation gate, required visible `Tr F` row,
  visible Green-Schwarz curvature packet, visible-source gate, and visible
  complex-worldvolume W3/spinC gate are now supplied; the naive coordinate
  active-image route is also blocked, and the finite twisted Chan-Paton rescue
  family is reduced to one projective D7 stack.  The executed volume data make
  S3 the unique conditional candidate, qutrit clock/shift symmetry reduces the
  choice to S3, and the minimal equivariant selector closes S3 using
  symmetry-compatible survivor labeling.  The selected S3 source packet gate
  now exists and correctly rejects the strongest current attempt.  The packet
  now also has finite S3 twisted Chan-Paton cancellation of the rank-two DD
  obstruction.  It also has an executable conditional smooth S3 source-lift
  gate: finite S3 cancellation and the conditional flat Deligne/Cech model fit
  together, but the selected cover/good-cover data, smooth S3 restriction,
  smooth Freed-Witten verification, and projector retention remain open.  The
  Deligne cover gauge reduction now sharpens that wording: the particular good
  cover is an auxiliary representative, not an MTT selection knob.  The
  selected S3 class/restriction closure now supplies the fixed smooth flat
  S3 class, its F_3^2 pullback table, smooth S3 Freed-Witten cancellation, and
  block-sector projector retention.  The packet still cannot be promoted
  because the selected visible Green-Schwarz/operator source, complete visible
  cycle/worldvolume source, coherent spectral zero-mode projector retention,
  and selected D_E/dotD source are not supplied.
  The old
  single-carrier
  obstruction remains true as a diagnostic: the qutrit clock/shift carrier is
  irreducible, hence its commutant is only C*I_3.  However the
  block-factorized sector-map packet now validates the finite projector data by
  placing H on a separate ordinary line.  The first active blocker is therefore
  selected gerbe/source promotion, not finite sector projectors.

  Iwasawa Twisted Source Promotion Packet Fill Attempt
---

# Purpose

The previous gate gave us an exact target:

```text
fill IwasawaTwistedSourcePromotionPacket.v1.
```

This note records the honest fill attempt.

# Filled Fields

The following fields can be filled from the existing projective carrier:

```text
central cocycle = nontrivial F_3^2 finite-Heisenberg cocycle,
omega order = 3,
commutator rank over F_3 = 2,
finite Heisenberg extension order = 27,
center order = 3,
ordinary bundle coboundary possible = false,
period denominator = 3,
central phase label = zeta_3^2,
time-oriented m=1 finite period table = closed,
time-oriented m=1 deck/Cech lift = closed,
time-oriented m=1 conditional flat gerbe = closed,
time-oriented m=1 Freed-Witten DD(B) cycle gate = closed,
time-oriented m=1 qutrit clock/shift line-cycle restrictions = closed,
visible complex-worldvolume W3/spinC gate = closed,
time-oriented m=1 Green-Schwarz preservation gate = closed,
time-oriented m=1 visible Green-Schwarz requirement = closed,
time-oriented m=1 visible Green-Schwarz curvature packet = closed,
time-oriented m=1 visible-source attempt gate = closed,
naive coordinate active F3 image route = blocked,
finite twisted Chan-Paton coordinate rescue family = reduced to one twisted D7 stack,
volume selector attempt = S3 conditional, MTT selector rule open,
qutrit-symmetry selector = S3 if selected F3^2-to-CY embedding preserves clock/shift symmetry,
equivariant embedding selector = minimal S3 selector closed, selected S3 source open,
selected S3 source packet gate = closed, selected source still open,
finite S3 twisted-CP cancellation = closed, smooth selected source still open,
conditional smooth S3 source-lift gate = formulated, refined by selected class/restriction closure,
Deligne cover gauge reduction = closed, particular good cover is auxiliary,
selected S3 class/restriction packet gate = formulated, closure below fills it,
selected S3 class/restriction closure = closed, smooth S3 class/pullback/FW and block projectors supplied,
projective rho_E mesh path = candidate_data/iwasawa_projective_magnetic_carrier.meshN1.json,
rho_E metric path = candidate_data/iwasawa_projective_magnetic_carrier.meshN1.json.
block-factorized sector maps =
candidate_data/iwasawa_block_factorized_sector_maps.candidate.json,
block-factorized twisted packet =
candidate_data/iwasawa_block_factorized_twisted_packet.candidate.json.
```

No observed masses, mixings, or benchmark matrices are used.

# Block-Factorized Sector Maps

The block-factorized sector-map packet validates:

```text
Q,u,d,L,e,N = full rank-three projectors on the projective qutrit family block,
H = rank-one projector on a separate ordinary trivial line,
projective rho_E mesh = passes,
rho_E metric = passes.
```

This retires the old rank-one-H-inside-qutrit obstruction as an active blocker
for the block-factorized route.  It does not by itself prove selected
twist/source data.  The selected S3 class/restriction closure now proves
retention for these block-sector projectors under the selected twisted S3
source, but coherent spectral zero-mode projectors still depend on the future
selected `D_E/dotD` operator source.

# Unfilled Selected Source Fields

These fields remain false:

```text
selected_twist_verified,
fixed_topological_sector for this twist,
selected_by_mtt,
complete selected visible cycle/worldvolume packet,
geometric Deligne/Cech or worldvolume-flux/Chan-Paton source for selected S3,
green_schwarz_bianchi_verified for this twist,
selected visible Green-Schwarz/operator source,
coherent spectral zero-mode projector retention for the selected operator source,
coherent_spectral_projector_verified.
```

The corpus now supplies the finite m=1 gerbe arithmetic, a conditional flat
gerbe promotion, the fact that flat torsion preserves closed Green-Schwarz
curvature sectors, the required visible `Tr F` row in the invariant basis, the
closed visible Green-Schwarz curvature packet, and an executable gate for the
selected visible source.  It also supplies the selected qutrit clock/shift
line-cycle restrictions and the visible complex-worldvolume W3/spinC gate for
D7 divisors S1,S2,S3 and matter curves Cij.  It still does not supply the
selected non-coordinate/isotropic active F_3^2 map or explicit twisted
cancellation for the complete visible worldvolume packet.  The naive
coordinate-divisor active-image route is now blocked by enumeration: at least
one coordinate D7 divisor always sees a rank-two active image.  The finite
twisted Chan-Paton rescue calculation then shows that if the active directions
are split between two coordinate factors, all matter curves remain ordinary
DD-zero and exactly one D7 stack carries the full qutrit projective module.
The volume-selector attempt singles out S3 only conditionally: S1 and S2 are
volume-degenerate, while S3 carries the 0.229 hierarchy.
The qutrit-symmetry selector sharpens this: the selected finite qutrit packet
contains clock and shift lines related by Fourier transport, and the executed
CY corner has only one equal-scale coordinate pair, T1,T2.  If the selected
embedding preserves that exchange symmetry, the active pair is T1,T2 and the
twisted stack is S3.
The equivariant embedding selector closes that minimal rule: MTT survivor
labels are symmetry-compatible and cannot be selected by coordinate artifacts,
so S1/S2 require an extra selected orientation-breaking source.  In the minimal
equivariant branch, the twisted stack is S3.
The visible twisted S3 source-packet gate then records this sharper state in
executable form: S3 is selected at stack level, but the packet fails until an
actual selected S3 differential-cohomology/worldvolume source, Freed-Witten
verification, and twisted projector-retention evidence are supplied.
The finite S3 twisted Chan-Paton cancellation closes the finite rank-two DD
piece: S3 can carry the matching q79/F,m=1 projective module, while S1, S2,
and the Cij matter curves remain ordinary.  This is still not a smooth
selected source theorem.
The smooth-source lift gate makes the remaining object precise: it accepts the
conditional flat Deligne/Cech representative only as an unselected scaffold and
rejects promotion until the selected cover/good-cover data, S3 restriction,
smooth Freed-Witten check, and projector-retention theorem are supplied.
The Deligne cover gauge reduction then removes the cover itself as a physical
knob: a good cover is representative data.  The selected-source problem is the
fixed smooth S3 class and its restriction, not choosing a privileged cover.
The selected S3 class/restriction packet gate records this refined target in
executable form.  The selected S3 class/restriction closure then supplies the
fixed smooth flat class, the S3 pullback table, smooth Freed-Witten
cancellation, and block-sector projector retention.  This closes the
post-cover S3 twisted-source target, but it does not yet supply the visible
operator source or spectral zero-mode projectors.

# Single-Carrier Sector Obstruction

The current qutrit carrier uses:

```text
X Z = omega Z X.
```

Because `Z` has three distinct eigenvalues, any matrix commuting with `Z` is
diagonal.  A diagonal matrix commuting with cyclic shift `X` must have equal
diagonal entries.  Therefore:

```text
Comm(X,Z) = C*I_3.
```

The only Hermitian idempotents in this commutant are:

```text
0 and I_3.
```

So the current irreducible qutrit carrier has no rank-one invariant projector.
It cannot fill the rank-one `H` sector inside a single qutrit carrier.  This
obstruction is real, but the block-factorized route avoids it by not placing H
inside the irreducible qutrit block.

# Consequence

The projective carrier is still valuable, and its role is now sharper:

```text
projective qutrit family carrier for Q,u,d,L,e,N,
separate ordinary Higgs line for H,
selected gerbe/B-field holonomy map still required.
```

# Correct Ways Forward

The immediate route is now:

```text
1. construct a selected visible Green-Schwarz/operator source whose Chern-Weil row
   realizes the derived alpha_1 coefficient on the same branch;
2. extend the selected S3 block-sector retention to coherent spectral
   zero-mode projectors for that operator source;
3. construct selected D_E and dotD on those blocks;
4. extract primitive C1 contractions and then Yukawa/CKM/PMNS magnitudes.
```

The packet has been filled as far as the current evidence allows.  It should
not be promoted to selected SM data yet.
