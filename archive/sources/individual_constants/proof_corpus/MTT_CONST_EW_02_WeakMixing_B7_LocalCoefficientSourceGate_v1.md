# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B7 Local Coefficient Source Gate v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B7_LOCAL_COEFFICIENT_SOURCE_GATE_BUILT_VALUES_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B7-LOCAL-COEFFICIENT-SOURCE`

## Result

B7 executes the local coefficient source hunt.

Closed now:

- exceptional projection formula `Delta_alpha_12 = 2*c1 - c2`,
- diagnostic coefficient classification,
- rejection of near-hit and reverse-engineered weights as proof,
- SU2 flat-background support,
- exact next gate selection.

Execution-I gives diagnostic coefficients

`c1 = 0.31`, `c2 = -0.27`,

and diagnostic split

`Delta_G_12 = 0.07082394967589342`.

These are not promoted as no-knob electroweak coefficients.

The strongest near-hit operator-weight diagnostic is

`two_thirds_u1_diagnostic`,

with `Delta_G_12 = 0.0718623805729687`.

It is also not promoted.

## SU2 Gate

The selected SU2 leading threshold background is flat/source-supported, but the
physical quotient policy is still open.

The conditional zero-extra branch would give

`lambda_12 = 2.41442942313547`,

but it requires the missing statement:

`Selected_SU2_Threshold_Background_is_Flat_and_FP_Determinant_is_Universal_or_Casimir_Absorbed`.
