# MTT Selected q79 Genus-Two Based Path System and Monodromy Candidate v1

Status: `MTT_U6_Q79_92_BASED_MONODROMY_PATH_CARRIERS_CLOSED_90_SP4Z_CANDIDATES_UNPROMOTED`

## What A113 closes

The square elliptic base is now used in its normalized uniformization

```text
E_i = C/(Z+iZ),
a=wp(w;i)/L^2,
b=wp'(w;i)/(2 L^3),
L=sqrt(2) K(1/2).
```

The diagonal four-torsion point `w_*=(1+i)/4` is the exact regular base point
`(a_*,b_*)=(-i,1+i)`. A112's 90 `a`-disks lift to 90 pairwise-disjoint torus
balls. The inverse bound uses `dw/da=1/(2 L b)` and a direct lower bound for
`|a^3-a|` on every A112 disk.

For each critical ball A113 chooses a universal-cover lift, a straight outbound
segment, and a positive circle enclosing that ball alone. Every segment and
circle has an explicit positive lower clearance from every other critical ball
and from the elliptic-coordinate pole. This closes 90 reproducible based
meridian carriers. The two torus-handle paths `A:w_* -> w_*+1` and
`B:w_* -> w_*+i` are also certified. The base-monodromy problem therefore has
92 path carriers, not only the 90 local meridians.

## What the long numerical execution found

The frozen FLINT exploration transports all six hyperelliptic branch points
around each meridian. Its 90 root permutations are transpositions. Replaying
all `3024` Artin generators in the common chain basis gives 90
integral `Sp(4,Z)` matrices. Every matrix satisfies

```text
rank(M-I)=1,
(M-I)^2=0,
M^T J M=J.
```

The candidate vanishing cycles contain
`25` distinct
primitive vectors up to sign and span all of `H_1(F_*,Z)=Z^4`. This is strong
consistency evidence and a concrete input to the next proof, not yet a promoted
monodromy theorem.

## Exact remaining promotion

The pointwise branch roots were isolated with FLINT, but no saved continuous
Rouche tube currently proves that each true strand is isotopic to the recorded
piecewise-linear strand over every adaptive segment. Consequently A113 keeps
all 90 matrices at candidate status. A114 must emit those disjoint tubes,
compute the `A` and `B` handle monodromies, normalize one ordered distinguished
cut system, and check the genus-one surface relation. Only then may the rank-four
Gauss-Manin local system feed the `8x92` period execution.

No beta period, gerbe zero, source selection, or strong-CP closure is inferred.
The constructive carrier still removes zero strict MTT source moduli.
