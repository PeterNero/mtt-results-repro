# UST.G1 Relative Augmented-Source Necessity and Two-Presentation Theorem v1

**Date:** 2026-08-03

**Status:** `EXACT_ROUTE_RELATIVE_NECESSITY_AND_TWO_PRESENTATION_CLASSIFICATION_PHYSICAL_SELECTION_AND_EQUIVALENCE_OPEN`

## 1. Scope and Result

Fix the **local q79 heterotic/Hull-Strominger route**. Require a source to
encode the complete local nonlinear deformation problem modulo gauge, its
same-source tangent/Hodge construction, and its q79 form-sector extension.

This scope is essential. The theorem does not prove that the heterotic route
is the unique possible TOE, nor that a formal internal germ determines global
Lorentzian spacetime, a nonperturbative measure, a recorder, or actualization.

Within this route, every admissible local source must determine at least

\[
\boxed{
\mathfrak N_*
=
\left(
s_*,
\widehat{\mathfrak Z}_{s_*},
(\mathcal Y_\bullet,\{\ell_n\}),
h_*,
\mathscr G_*
\right)
}
\]

up to gauge and \(L_\infty\) quasi-isomorphism, where:

- \(s_*\) is a selected local physical endpoint modulo gauge;
- \(\widehat{\mathfrak Z}_{s_*}\) is its augmented derived zero-locus germ;
- \(\mathcal Y_\bullet\) is the full augmented heterotic complex;
- \(\ell_n\) encode the unary differential and nonlinear deformation data;
- \(h_*\) is the declared positive/Hermitian pairing that fixes adjoints;
- \(\mathscr G_*\) records the infinitesimal gauge action and stabilizers.

A cyclic enhancement is desirable but is not assumed closed here. A finite
readout \(T_{\mathrm{fin}}\) also remains separate unless a theorem derives it
canonically from \(\mathfrak N_*\).

The locked corpus leaves two source presentations:

\[
\mathscr C_{\mathrm{bun}}
=\text{ordinary physical }V_3/W_9^\tau
\text{ Hull-Strominger germ},
\]

\[
\mathscr C_{\mathrm{coh}}
=\text{physical derived-cohesive superconnection germ}
+\text{ physical transform}.
\]

Neither is selected physically. A later `UST.G1E` theorem proves the canonical
bundle-to-cohesive embedding; reverse physical representability remains open.

## 2. Candidate-Independent Requirements

The requirements are fixed before ranking presentations:

1. **Physical provenance (`PROV`).** Bind the local endpoint and outputs to one
   source orbit and source hash.
2. **Augmented completeness (`AUG`).** Retain the full triangular form-sector
   extension or prove a gauge/homotopy reduction that removes it.
3. **Nonlinear completion (`NONLIN`).** Retain a Maurer-Cartan or equivalent
   nonlinear defect and enough higher operations to distinguish interactions.
4. **Metric completion (`METRIC`).** Retain the relative normalization and
   positive/Hermitian pairing that determine adjoints and Hodge operators.
5. **Gauge/equation completion (`GAUGE`).** Retain the infinitesimal gauge
   action, stabilizers or slices, and all selected physical equation rows.
6. **Transport declaration (`MAPS`).** Supply each claimed lower readout map,
   or a theorem proving that map canonical, with compatibility and error data.

These are readout requirements, not Hull-Strominger equations disguised as a
uniqueness criterion. The theorem remains relative to the declared heterotic
route because `GAUGE` asks for that route's physical equations.

## 3. Exact Augmented Unary Object

The geometric deformation block is

\[
\mathcal Q_{\mathrm{phys}}
=T^*X\oplus\operatorname{ad}(TX)
\oplus\operatorname{ad}(V_3)
\oplus\operatorname{ad}(W_9^\tau)\oplus TX,
\]

of complex rank 102. It is not the complete source. The full complex is

\[
\mathcal Y_n
=\Omega^{0,n}(\mathcal Q_{\mathrm{phys}})
\oplus\Omega^{0,n+1}(X),
\]

\[
L_n=\ell_{1,n}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
D_n & \frac12(-1)^n A_n\\
0 & C_n
\end{pmatrix},
\quad
D=\bar D_Q,\ A=\partial,\ C=\bar\partial.
\]

Its cochain law is equivalent to

\[
D_{n+1}D_n=0,\qquad C_{n+1}C_n=0,
\qquad D_{n+1}A_n-A_{n+1}C_n=0.
\]

There is an exact sequence

\[
0\longrightarrow(\mathcal Q_\bullet,D)
\longrightarrow(\mathcal Y_\bullet,L)
\longrightarrow(\mathcal B_\bullet,C)
\longrightarrow0.
\]

Projection back to \(\mathcal Q\) is generally not a chain map. The pulled-back
K3 holomorphic two-form makes the extra form lane nonzero on the q79 branch,
so eliminating it requires a separate quotient, connecting-map or mass
theorem.

## 4. Exact Universal Nonlinear and Hodge Statement

For an uncurved Hilbert \(L_3\) algebra, freeze one sign convention and define

\[
\operatorname{MC}(a)
=L_1a+\frac12\ell_2(a,a)+\frac1{3!}\ell_3(a,a,a),
\]

\[
\Phi_{\mathrm{MC}}(a)
=\left(\operatorname{MC}(a),L_0^\dagger a\right).
\]

At the zero solution,

\[
D\Phi_{\mathrm{MC}}(0)
=J_1
=
\begin{pmatrix}L_1\\L_0^\dagger\end{pmatrix},
\]

and therefore

\[
\operatorname{Hess}_0
\frac12\|\Phi_{\mathrm{MC}}\|^2
=J_1^\dagger J_1
=L_1^\dagger L_1+L_0L_0^\dagger
=\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}.
\]

This universal Maurer-Cartan-plus-gauge statement is exact.

It must not be silently promoted to the complete physical residual. If extra
physical rows \(R\) have derivative \(K\), then

\[
\widetilde\Phi=(\Phi_{\mathrm{MC}},R)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\operatorname{Hess}\frac12\|\widetilde\Phi\|^2
=\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}+K^\dagger K.
\]

Equality with \(\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}\) therefore requires a new theorem that
the HYM, moment-map, balanced and anomaly rows are redundant in the selected
target metric, are already represented in \(\operatorname{MC}\), or combine by
a Kaehler/moment-map identity. This is not assumed in `UST.G1`.

## 5. Physical Configuration Target

Conditionally fix the q79 topology and branch, shared differential line,
complex/root-stack data, visible and hidden bundle types, tangent-connection
convention and normalization. For \(p>3\), the analytic target is a
gauge-fixed \(W^{2,p}\) chart containing

\[
(J,\Omega,\omega,A_V,A_W,\nabla,B/H).
\]

The intended physical rows include:

```text
visible and hidden F^(0,2),
visible and hidden Lambda_omega F,
tangent instanton rows under the selected convention,
anomaly/Bianchi row,
conformally balanced row,
bundle Coulomb and geometric gauge rows,
positivity as a domain guard.
```

What is exact globally today is the infinitesimal gauge complex

\[
\mathcal Y_0\xrightarrow{L_0}\mathcal Y_1
\]

and the Hilbert slice \(L_0^\dagger a=0\), together with bundle Coulomb slices
in the basic chart. A complete global gauge group combining bundle,
geometric and gerbe transformations remains open and must not be identified
with the projected SM gauge group.

Given a selected compact boundaryless Hermitian endpoint and bundle metrics,
smooth sections complete to \(\mathcal H_n=L^2(\mathcal Y_n)\). Each \(L_n\)
has its maximal closed graph domain. Under the established ellipticity
hypotheses, \(\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}\) is nonnegative, self-adjoint and has
compact resolvent. The relative \(\mathcal Q/B\) normalization still must come
from the selected geometry or action.

## 6. Necessity Proofs

### 6.1 Rank-102 insufficiency

The exact compression theorem gives

\[
p_Q\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}i_Q
=\Delta_{Q,1}+\frac14A_0A_0^\dagger.
\]

An exact witness has bare compression 1 and full compression 2. Thus the
rank-102 block cannot determine the upper Hodge operator without a reduction
theorem.

### 6.2 Hessian insufficiency

For

\[
f_\lambda(s)=\frac\kappa2s^2+\frac\lambda4s^4,
\]

all \(\lambda\) have the same value, gradient and Hessian at zero but different
fourth derivative \(6\lambda\). Linear or Hessian data cannot select nonlinear
vertices.

### 6.3 Pairing necessity

The exact weighted witness yields

\[
\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}=\frac{14}{5}I_2,
\]

while the unweighted transpose gives \(2I_2\). The differential does not
select its adjoint or Hodge operator.

### 6.4 Topological non-determination

Rank, Chern, index and finite holonomy constrain a physical source but do not
determine the HYM residual, its Jacobian, Green operator or Newton bounds.

### 6.5 Map necessity

Equal terminal matrices or values do not identify their lifts. Without a
declared map and stabilizer data, the source fiber may be empty, discrete or
positive dimensional. A finite shadow is not its own source certificate.

Together these prove that topology, finite operators, the rank-102 block and a
Hessian are typed partial objects rather than rival complete local sources.

## 7. Two Surviving Presentations

### 7.1 Ordinary bundle presentation

The first route seeks a literal physical \(V_3/W_9^\tau\) pair, common
Gauduchon/HYM chamber and full augmented Hull-Strominger germ on \(X_{q79}\).
It depends directly on the selected eta9/Deligne visible source.

### 7.2 Derived-cohesive presentation

The second route seeks a physical twisted cohesive superconnection germ and a
physical transform to the bundle/finite presentations. The existing
\(S_{\mathrm{HS}}\) is an exact nonlinear/Hodge benchmark but has the wrong
physical Chern rows; that excludes the representative, not the entire route.

Every ordinary bundle germ has a canonical cohesive presentation. A general
cohesive germ represents an ordinary physical bundle source only if there
exists a reverse physical transform

\[
F_X:\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{coh}}\longrightarrow
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{bun}}
\]

preserving:

1. the augmented differential and form-sector connecting map;
2. nonlinear residual and higher products;
3. infinitesimal gauge action and stabilizers;
4. physical pairing and Hodge operator;
5. Chern/anomaly and shared-line data;
6. the declared continuum-to-finite readout.

A verified obstruction to a required preservation law prevents ordinary
bundle promotion but need not exclude a genuinely derived physical source.

## 8. Typed Adjudication

| Object | Type | Exact role | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| q79 topology/Chern/index data | constraint | discrete branch and anomaly/index constraints | retain constraint |
| finite `(P,Q,J_DE)` | shadow | exact finite repair/unitary structure | required finite test |
| cohesive `S_HS` | benchmark presentation | exact MC/Hodge/Fitting testbed with nonphysical rows | retain benchmark |
| rank-102 complex | tangent subcomplex | physical geometric deformation block | retain block |
| Hodge Hessian | tangent output | repair generator after a pairing | retain output |
| four-row `S_phys` | source presentation | minimal endpoint input contract | retain input contract |
| ordinary augmented bundle germ | source class | possible physical local source | survivor, open |
| derived-cohesive germ plus transform | source class | possible physical local source | survivor, open |

## 9. Frontier Delta

`UST.G1` closes at the **finite two-presentation classification tier**:

```text
route-relative necessary normal form: augmented metric derived zero-locus germ
surviving presentations: ordinary bundle and derived-cohesive
bundle-to-cohesive embedding: closed later by UST.G1E
reverse physical representability: open
physical representative: open
```

No physical theorem or global TOE uniqueness claim is promoted.

The next local target after `UST.G1E` is the selected physical source `UST.G3`.
The universal full-residual-to-Hodge formula, including the possible positive
correction \(K^\dagger K\), is proved separately as `UST.G2`.
