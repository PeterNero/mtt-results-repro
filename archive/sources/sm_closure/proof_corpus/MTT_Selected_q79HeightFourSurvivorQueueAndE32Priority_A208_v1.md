# MTT Selected q79 Height-Four Survivor Queue and E32 Priority A208 v1

## Result

A208 reruns the unchanged A132 Kannan grid and retains every height-four vector
whose eight floating centers enter the A132 beta component balls. The grid emits
575 distinct vectors, 85 center-nonseparated vectors, and exactly five such
height-four vectors. The published A132 seed is the unique winner under A132's
recorded lexicographic objective. A207 rigorously rejects that one seed only.

The floating E32-priority survivor is A132 rank
`3`, candidate `5224d7bf54fb9115`, at
`0.0001566875798176861`. This is a
candidate-prioritization diagnostic, not a proof of equality and not a new MTT
selection theorem.

## Exact scope

The fixed A132 grid has now been enumerated without changing its scale, weights,
or marker multipliers. There is one exact objective winner and four untested
height-four survivors. No symmetry quotient is applied because no proved
symmetry preserving the refined retarded beta equation is available. In
particular, antiunitary or conjugate partners are not silently discarded.

This is still not an exhaustive theorem over `Z^90`. It proves completeness only
for the finite Kannan grid that A132 actually used. The four survivors must be
decided by interval arithmetic before any stronger carrier claim is made.

## Next computation

The union of new thimble indices required by all four survivors is
`[2, 3, 24, 25, 27, 36, 38, 41, 42, 56, 64, 72, 78, 79, 90]`: 15 intervals. After those rows and the survivor-specific
handle combinations are certified, the same E32 zero-exclusion gate used by
A207 can decide every fixed-grid height-four survivor.

No observed Standard Model value is used.
