# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B31 Clause Proof And Row Packet Frontier v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B31_CLAUSEPROOF_AND_ROWPACKET_FRONTIER_BUILT`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B31-SOURCE-IDENTITY-CLAUSE-PROOF-AND-HONEST-KERNEL-EXPORT`

## Closed Now

```text
finite trace measure = normalized trace/Frobenius pairing  True
formal 110 rows executed                                      True
36 sector rows assembled formally                             True
2 Hessian/source rows assembled formally                       True
```

## Still Rejected

The strict final-source validator still rejects current support after this
subclaim is imported. The reason is no longer numerical exactness. It is source
provenance:

```text
same-branch Phi_fin^C1 source emission          open
same-source b_selected/Hessian emission         open
residual-projector replay excluded as source    open
actual independent row packet                   open
```

## Not A Cycle

B31 does not replay B27-B30. It closes one source-identity subclause and turns
the remaining problem into a minimal payload:

1. same-source `Phi_fin^C1` / `b_selected` emission, or
2. actual independent finite C1 row packet.
