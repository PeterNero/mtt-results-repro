# MTT Selected C1VariationPrincipleDerivation or QuadratureEngineRun v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_C1VARIATIONPRINCIPLE_OR_QUADRATUREENGINERUN_BUILT_ENGINE_SKELETON_PRINCIPLE_DERIVATION_OPEN`.

Route A now has the formal variational algebra attached:

```text
finite Euler projection derived       = True
least-norm Q_residual selection       = True
physical C1 action/source derived     = False
boundary cancellation derived         = False
```

Route B now has the selected engine skeleton:

```text
basis rows selected                   = 19/19
primitive rows required               = 72
primitive rows replay-backed          = 36
primitive rows independent            = 0
hessian/source rows required          = 2
sector response rows required         = 36
independent engine run executed       = False
```

The gate is therefore not numerically vague anymore. It is missing one of two
precise objects: either the selected physical `Phi_fin^C1` variation/source
principle, or the selected quadrature measure/kernel values with an exact run.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PhysicalVariationPrincipleSource_or_QuadratureKernelValues_v1`.
