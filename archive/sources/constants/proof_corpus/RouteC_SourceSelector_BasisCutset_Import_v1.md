# RouteC SourceSelector BasisCutset Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_SOURCE_SELECTOR_BASIS_CUTSET_IMPORTED_PROVENANCE_OR_BASIS_OPEN`.

The remaining Route-C/Strominger Galerkin calculation is now an exact cutset.
The honest root manifest and formal-lift diagnostic manifest use the same
finite matrices; their total difference is `36` false-to-true provenance flags.

This closes matrix-disagreement as the blocker.  It does not close proof
promotion.  The two live proof objects are:

- selected-source provenance for the Route-C residual, operators, Riesz/Green,
  dotD source, and alpha1 driver flags
- quotient-valid selected `B_N` basis/operator extraction, including basis
  functions, deck constraints, bundle transitions, quadrature, stiffness/Gram
  entries, and selected `D_E` action

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RouteC_Source_Provenance_or_Basis_Certificate_v1`.
