# MTT Selected Route-C Stability/HYM or Route-C Residual Source

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEC_STABILITY_ATTEMPT_CENTRAL_NEUTRAL_CLOSED_GLOBAL_ENUMERATION_OPEN`

This is the direct attempt to prove the rank-two stability/HYM gate.

## Proven Subtheorem

For the selected rank-two extension

```text
0 -> L -> V_alpha -> L^-1 -> 0
L = (1,-2,0)
p = (1,2,1)
```

with the selected nonzero Ext vector in `H1(L^2)`, all central-neutral
base-pullback rank-one destabilizer candidates are obstructed in the reduced
Kunneth/Appell-Humbert Yoneda model.

Concretely:

- `L` has negative slope in the selected chamber.
- The quotient `L^-1` is excluded by the non-split Ext class.
- The Hom cone reduces central-neutral nonnegative-slope candidates to six
  classes.
- All six candidates have injective Yoneda boundary maps in the reduced model.
- The previously remaining zero-slope scalar is nonzero.
- Appell-Humbert degree addition conditionally realizes the reduced Yoneda
  multiplication, preserving the shared-circle degree zero condition.

## Not Yet Proved

This does not close full stability/HYM. The missing final mathematical step is
one of:

- prove every rank-one torsion-free destabilizing subsheaf has central-neutral
  base-pullback reflexive hull, or
- supply a selected HYM/Strominger or Route-C residual source directly.

Until then, the result is a strong stability subtheorem, not a selected HYM
existence certificate.
