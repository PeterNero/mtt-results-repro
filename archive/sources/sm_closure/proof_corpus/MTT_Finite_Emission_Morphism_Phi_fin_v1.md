# MTT Finite Emission Morphism Phi_fin v1

## Result

`Phi_fin` is not closed as selected data, but its finite codomain schema is now
identified.  The q79/F,m=1 Route-C files provide the scaffold for the morphism:
residuals, `rho_E`, metric, sector maps, `D_E`, Riesz/gap, reduced Green, and
`dotD`.  The same files also prove why they cannot be promoted: the source flags
are false and `rho_E` is identity smoke.

## Superset Classification

`SUPERSET_REPAIR_SCHEMA_NOT_SELECTED_VALUES`

This is a superset repair schema.  It does not combine paths to close values;
it locks the exact finite target that selected Appell-Humbert, gerbe/Chan-Paton,
or Strominger/HYM data must fill.

## Shape Gates

- `residual_codomain_shape_present`: `PASS`
- `positive_gap_fields_present`: `PASS`
- `sector_slots_present`: `PASS`
- `de_riesz_green_dotd_shapes_present`: `PASS`

## Selected Flags

- `route_c_residual`: `False`
- `rhoE_mesh`: `False`
- `de_action`: `False`
- `riesz_gap`: `False`
- `reduced_green`: `False`
- `dotd_response`: `False`
- `dotd_alpha1`: `False`

## Minimum New Selected Data

- non-identity selected rho_E transition matrices or functions from Appell-Humbert/gerbe/monad source
- selected Hermitian metric and connection A* from the q79/F,m=1 Strominger/HYM minimizer
- selected D_E action matrices derived from A*, not from the smoke slot
- selected Riesz projectors, complement gaps, and Green operators with gap/truncation proof
- selected dotD_alpha1 driver and horizontal responses from the same branch
- primitive C1 overlap tensors or a theorem reducing them to the selected D_E/dotD/Green package

## Theorem

`FiniteEmissionMorphismPhiFinSchema` is proved:

The finite codomain and validator schema for Phi_fin are identified. The current q79/F,m=1 Route-C files are a valid execution scaffold but not selected data. Phi_fin must reuse this schema while replacing identity rhoE and lifted source flags with outputs derived from the selected Strominger/HYM minimizer.
