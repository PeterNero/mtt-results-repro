# MTT Selected ChernWeilDE or DeterminantTorsion ThreeSlotClosingRun v1

This artifact checks the three remaining operator-source slots after the
selected diagonal HYM residual slot closure.

It closes one more slot:
`same_source_Chern_Weil_row_derived`.

The closure is deliberately narrow.  The selected q79/F,m=1 rank-two
`V_alpha` HYM lane and the q79 Chern/Bianchi packet name the same source:

- branch `q=79`, orientation `F`, torsion label `m=1`
- source shape `0 -> L -> V_alpha -> L^-1 -> 0`
- `L=(1,-2,0)` and `L^2=(2,-4,0)`
- `c1(V_alpha)=(0,0,0)`
- `c2(V_alpha)=(4,0,0) = 4 alpha_1`
- `ch2(V_alpha)=(-4,0,0)`

Therefore the same-source Chern-Weil row is closed at the
cohomology/Chern-Bianchi row level.

This does not emit transition `rho_E`/Cech-Dolbeault `D_E` tables, a
pointwise finite curvature representative, determinant / heat / torsion
response, the full sector-ready Qa/SU3 dynamic operator packet, or a no-knob
derivation of all Standard Model data.

Current count is now six closed operator-source slots and two open slots.

Remaining open slots:

- `transition_rhoE_or_Cech_Dolbeault_DE_data`
- `finite_determinant_heat_spectrum_or_torsion_response`

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_DETransition_or_DeterminantTorsion_TwoSlotClosingRun_v1`.
