# One Anchor Einstein Response Assembly v1

## Result

The conditional one-anchor low-energy TT Einstein response is assembled.

Closed ingredients:

```text
TT support identity: Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT
TT support: |d_*> tensor span{c2,s2}
lambda_GR,TT,int = 15
kappa_STF = (32*pi*G_eff)^(-1)
```

With a length anchor `L0`:

```text
G_eff = 0.297593629324318 * L0^2
kappa_STF = 0.0334253927606864 / L0^2
h_TT = 29.9173747084929 * L0^2 * G_ret,TT T_TT
```

With an energy anchor `E0`:

```text
G_eff = 0.297593629324318 / E0^2
kappa_STF = 0.0334253927606864 * E0^2
h_TT = 29.9173747084929 * E0^-2 * G_ret,TT T_TT
```

## What This Closes

Given one metrological primitive and the selected matter stress map/operator
identity gates, the low-energy TT Einstein response has no remaining GR
normalization knob. The response coefficient is fixed by the selected `N=448`
row.

## What Remains Open

```text
selected full matter stress coefficients
unconditional GR TT operator identity
literal GR TT noise-channel identity
absolute SI metrology if measured numbers are required
```

So this is a conditional Einstein-response assembly, not a claim that measured
Newton/Planck values or the full non-TT nonlinear Einstein equation have been
predicted.
