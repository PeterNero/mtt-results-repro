# Question

After closing the qutrit clock/shift line-cycle restrictions, what can be said
about W3 or spinC for the larger visible worldvolume class?

The execution corpus supplies a visible brane-stack class on the CY corner:

```text
three D7 stacks wrap complex divisors S1,S2,S3 in X6,
bifundamental matter lives on pairwise intersections Cij=S_i cap S_j.
```

# SpinC Theorem

Every complex manifold, and every smooth complex submanifold, is canonically
spinC.  The reason is:

```text
w2(TY) = c1(TY) mod 2.
```

Therefore the obstruction class:

```text
W3(Y)
```

vanishes for the complex worldvolume class.  Taking the product with the spin
four-dimensional spacetime factor preserves spinC.

# Result

For the visible complex-worldvolume class named by the execution corpus:

```text
S1, S2, S3: spinC, W3=0,
C12, C23, C31: spinC, W3=0.
```

This closes the W3/spinC side for the complex brane-stack/divisor and
matter-curve class.

# What Remains Open

This does not close the full m=1 Freed-Witten packet.  The m=1 flat gerbe has a
3-torsion DD class, and the validator still needs:

```text
image(pi1(Y) -> F_3^2)
```

for each visible worldvolume.  Those active images are not supplied by the
current corpus.  A worldvolume whose active image spans both generators fails;
rank zero or rank one passes.

# Frontier

The remaining complete-cycle question is therefore no longer a generic W3
question.  It is:

```text
what are the active F_3^2 images of S1,S2,S3 and Cij
on the q79/F,m=1 branch?
```

Once those images are supplied, the existing selected-cycle validator can decide
the full DD(B) part.

# What This Does Not Claim

This does not claim:

```text
complete Freed-Witten verification,
active DD(B) restrictions for S1,S2,S3,Cij,
selected visible SM operator source,
projector retention,
selected D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green files,
primitive C1 contractions,
full SM closure.
```

# Artifact

The executable constructor is:

```text
scripts/prove_visible_complex_worldvolume_spinc_gate.py
```

It writes:

```text
candidate_data/visible_complex_worldvolume_spinc_gate.candidate.json
certificates/visible_complex_worldvolume_spinc_gate_certificate.json
```

# Verdict

Closed:

```text
W3/spinC for the visible complex-worldvolume class.
```

Open:

```text
active F_3^2 images and DD(B) restrictions for the complete visible packet.
```
