# MTT Selected SectorTransferOverlapDerivative or RowLocalPrefactorEmission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_SECTORTRANSFER_OVERLAPDERIVATIVE_RECONCILED_ROWLOCAL_SCALAR_VALUES_OPEN`.

## Theorem

`SelectedSectorTransferOverlapDerivativeReconciliationTheorem` is emitted.

## What This Closes

This artifact imports the later selected physical-dotD/stationary-sector packets
against the Step73 honest row-local Galerkin gate.

```text
Step73 transfer/dotD blocker superseded for current K attempt : true
stationary sector transfer imported                           : true
physical dotD_alpha1 imported                                 : true
dynamic first-response support imported                       : true
generation-resolved theta exponent rows                       : true
prefactor formula contract                                    : true
```

## What Still Does Not Close

selected HYM projector values promoted        : false
rowwise scalar retarded-overlap values emitted: false
selected T_scheme rows emitted                : false

accepted row-local prefactor source rows      : 0
accepted K_threshold source rows              : 0
accepted Omega source rows                    : 0
strict Omega acceptance closed                : false
true SM equivalence closed                    : false
full no-knob closure                          : false
```

## Minimal Remaining Source Object

`SelectedRowwiseScalarRetardedOverlapAndSchemeValueRows` must emit:

- ten `L_rowlocal.Omega_*` scalar quadrature rows,
- ten `T_scheme.Omega_*` rows or a source-selected universal scheme rule,
- the `lambda_H` payload for `Omega_H.lambda`,
- row-level certificates before admitted replay values enter.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RowwiseScalarRetardedOverlapQuadratureValues_or_TSchemeLambdaHExecution_v1`.
