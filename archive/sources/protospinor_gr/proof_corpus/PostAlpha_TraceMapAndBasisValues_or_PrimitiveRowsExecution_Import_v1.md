# PostAlpha Trace Map and Basis Values or Primitive Rows Execution Import v1

## Result

Stationary selected trace-map and basis data are now filled.

Closed now:

```text
stationary selected trace-map values   = True
selected basis/projector/Gram/gap rows = 19/19
primitive row ids locked               = 72
```

Still open:

```text
dynamic dotD / Phi_fin^C1 trace binding
primitive quadrature rows
hessian/source rows
sector matrix rows
physical first-variation identity
boundary cancellation for dynamic C1 trace
```

The key distinction is that stationary transported HYM/End0 trace data are accepted, but primitive C1 rows still require the differentiated dynamic trace binding.
