# MTT Selected ResidualCompletion SourcePromotion or HonestGalerkinC1 Emission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_RESIDUALCOMPLETION_SOURCEPROMOTION_OR_HONESTGALERKINC1_EMISSION_BUILT_PROMOTION_GATE_OPEN`.

This artifact turns the diagnostic residual completion into a minimal selected
source-packet template.

```text
phase residual R_Z norm^2 per sector = 4.0
shift residual R_X norm^2 per sector = 2.0
phase residual rank                  = 2
shift residual rank                  = 2
closure error                         = 0.0
```

## Two Lanes

Lane A: prove that the same-branch differentiated vertex, basis transport, or
Hessian counterterm emits `R_Z` and `R_X`.

Lane B: run an honest selected Galerkin C1 emission that supplies zero-mode
bases, primitive 3x3 contractions, response matrices, and rank tests.

## SM-Parity View

For this repo, Qa/SU3 and the dynamic C1 packet are judged in the SM-parity
view.  A typed selected packet is enough for parity even if no-knob constants
remain for later.  Support-only, diagnostic, lifted, conditional, or
target-ranked packets still do not close the gate.

If either lane emits selected data, the downstream linear algebra is fixed:

```text
A^T A       = [[12, 0], [0, 12]]
A^T b       = [12, 12]
deltaTheta  = [1, 1]
```

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target
residuals are used as selectors.
