# MTT Selected RThetaVSD02StrictReplay or ResponseFunctionalRoute v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_RTHETA_VSD02STRICTREPLAY_OR_RESPONSEFUNCTIONALROUTE_BUILT_NO_ROWS_ACCEPTED_ROUTE_ATOMIC`.

This artifact replays the current `R_theta` handoff against the VSD-02 strict
fill frontier.

```text
stale selected-source-owner failure retired : true
VSD02 row routes classified                 : 6
accepted VSD02 source rows                  : 0
strict fill attempt closed                  : true
response functional contract closed         : true
response functional instantiated            : false
external likelihood workspace acquired      : false
```

So the blocker is no longer the old VSD-01 source-owner issue.  The next live
target is atomic:

- derive the selected internal `R_theta` threshold response functional,
- or import an accepted full external likelihood/threshold source workspace,
- or explicitly declare a minimal universal parameter policy if no-knob source
  derivation fails.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_ResponseFunctionalAtomicRoutes_or_ExternalLikelihoodAcquisition_v1`.
