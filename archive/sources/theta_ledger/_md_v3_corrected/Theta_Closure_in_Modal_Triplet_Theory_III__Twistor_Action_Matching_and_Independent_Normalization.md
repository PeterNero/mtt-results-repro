  Theta Closure in Modal Triplet Theory III:
  Twistor--Action Matching and Independent Normalization
---

# Relation to Papers I and II

This paper is the third component of the conservative $\Theta$--closure program:

- **Paper I** established the $\Theta$--closure framework and extracted
  numerical overlap targets from Standard Model data.

- **Paper II** computed $I_2^{(0)}$ and $I_3^{(0)}$ directly from internal
  geometry (Route A).

- **Paper III** (this paper) re--derives the same quantities using the
  twistor--encoded gauge action (Route B).

Agreement between Routes A and B provides a nontrivial internal consistency
check of the MTT overlap formulation.

# Introduction

Modal Triplet Theory (MTT) proposes that observable four--dimensional physics
arises from a coherent projection of a higher--dimensional modal configuration
space. In this framework, gauge couplings are not fundamental parameters but
emerge from overlap integrals of internal harmonic representatives.
A central goal of the $\Theta$--closure program is to show that these overlap
integrals are not free inputs but are fixed---up to controlled error---by internal
geometry and coherence structure.

In Paper I, we established a conservative $\Theta$--closure framework, deriving
numerical overlap targets for the nonabelian gauge sectors from experimentally
measured Standard Model couplings evolved to a common matching scale
$\mu_\Theta=5~\mathrm{TeV}$. In Paper II, we performed a direct geometric
evaluation (Route A) of the leading--order overlaps $I_2^{(0)}$ and $I_3^{(0)}$
on the baseline internal space
$S^1_{\mathrm{cen}}\times L(3,1)\times\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ and showed
that they can match the $\Theta$--targets while satisfying all admissibility and
spectral gap constraints.

The purpose of the present paper is to complete the program by providing a
genuinely independent derivation of the same overlap normalizations using
twistor--action methods (Route B). Unlike Route A, which relies on explicit
internal metric integrals, Route B fixes normalization constants via the
canonical measure on the twistor fiber and the structure of the self--dual
Yang--Mills action in the high--coherence regime.

We show that:

- for the $SU(2)$ sector, the overlap normalization is fixed uniquely by
  twistor fiber geometry, independent of internal Laplacian bounds;

- for the $SU(3)$ sector, explicit incorporation of the internal color fiber
  $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ yields a factorized normalization that agrees
  exactly with Route A;

- both routes identify the same leading--order overlaps with controlled
  corrections suppressed by the coherence gap.

This establishes Route B as a true alternative to Route A at leading order and
completes the conservative $\Theta$--closure of the nonabelian gauge sector.

# Twistor corner and SDYM action

## High--coherence twistor regime

The twistor formulation of MTT identifies a high--coherence regime in which the
effective dynamics of the massless gauge sector reduces to self--dual Yang--Mills
(SDYM) theory encoded holomorphically on twistor space.

#### Assumption

We assume the matching scale $\mu_\Theta$ lies in the high--coherence regime
for the massless gauge sector, so that:

1.  SDYM provides the leading--order gauge dynamics;

2.  massive corrections are suppressed by $O(\lambda_Q^{-1})$;

3.  the twistor action yields a well--defined kinetic normalization.

## Twistor action for SDYM

The SDYM action admits a twistor--space formulation of the form
$$S_{\mathrm{tw}} = \frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{\mathbb{PT}} \mathrm{Tr}\big(F^{(0,2)}\wedge \star F^{(0,2)}\big),$$
where:

- $\mathbb{PT}$ is the relevant region of projective twistor space,

- $F^{(0,2)}$ is the holomorphic curvature,

- $g_{\mathrm{tw}}$ is the twistor--action coupling.

The normalization of $g_{\mathrm{tw}}$ determines the effective four--dimensional
gauge kinetic term upon reconstruction.

# Reconstruction of the four--dimensional gauge action

## Ward correspondence and spacetime fields

By the Ward correspondence, holomorphic vector bundles on twistor space
correspond to SDYM solutions on spacetime.
The reconstruction map yields a spacetime gauge field $A_\mu$ whose kinetic term
is obtained by integrating over the twistor fiber.

At leading order, this produces a four--dimensional action
$$S_{\mathrm{4d}} = \frac{1}{4g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
\int_{Y^4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\,d\mathrm{vol}_4.$$

## Matching of couplings

The effective coupling $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is related to the twistor coupling
$g_{\mathrm{tw}}$ by
$$\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{\mathcal F} \langle \psi, \psi\rangle\,d\mu_{\mathcal F},$$
where:

- $\mathcal F$ is the internal fiber associated with the gauge sector,

- $\psi$ is the normalized twistor harmonic corresponding to the massless mode.

This integral is the twistor analogue of the internal overlap integral
$I_a^{(0)}$ defined in Papers I and II.

# Identification of $I_2^{(0)}$ and $I_3^{(0)}$

## General matching principle

Comparing the twistor reconstruction with the overlap formulation
$$\frac{1}{g_a^2} = \frac{1}{g_{10}^2} I_a,$$
we identify
$$I_a^{(0)} \;\equiv\;
\int_{\mathcal F_a} \langle \psi_a^{(0)}, \psi_a^{(0)}\rangle\,d\mu_{\mathcal F_a},$$
where $\psi_a^{(0)}$ is the massless twistor harmonic for the $SU(a)$ sector.

## SU(2) sector: complete Route B normalization

We now complete Route B for the $SU(2)$ gauge sector by fixing the overlap
normalization entirely within the twistor--action formalism, independent of
any internal geometric spectral bounds used in Route A.

### Twistor fiber normalization

In the high--coherence twistor corner, each spacetime point $x\in Y^4$
corresponds to a twistor line $L_x\cong\mathbb{CP}^1$.
We equip $L_x$ with the standard Fubini--Study Kähler form
$\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$ normalized by
$$\begin{equation}
\int_{L_x}\omega_{\mathrm{FS}} = 2\pi.
\label{eq:FS_norm}
\end{equation}$$
This normalization fixes the fiber measure uniquely and removes any overall
constant ambiguity in the twistor action.

### Twistor SDYM action

The self--dual Yang--Mills action in twistor space is taken to be
$$\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{tw}}[{\cal A}]
=
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{\mathbb{PT}}
\mathrm{Tr}\!\left(
{\cal F}^{(0,2)}\wedge \star {\cal F}^{(0,2)}
\right),
\label{eq:twistor_action_SU2}
\end{equation}$$
where ${\cal A}$ is a $(0,1)$ connection on a rank--2 holomorphic bundle over
$\mathbb{PT}$ and ${\cal F}^{(0,2)}$ is its $(0,2)$ curvature.
The normalization of $g_{\mathrm{tw}}$ is fixed once Equation (FS_norm) is chosen.

### Reconstruction to spacetime

By the Ward correspondence, solutions of the twistor field equations correspond
to self--dual Yang--Mills fields on spacetime.
Linearizing Equation (twistor_action_SU2) about the trivial bundle and
restricting to the massless sector yields a four--dimensional action
$$\begin{equation}
S_{4}[A]
=
\frac{1}{4g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
\int_{Y^4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\,d\mathrm{vol}_4,
\label{eq:4d_SU2}
\end{equation}$$
where the effective coupling is given by a fiber integral:
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{L_x}
\|\psi^{(0)}\|^2\,d\mu_{L_x}.
\label{eq:SU2_fiber_norm}
\end{equation}$$
Here $\psi^{(0)}$ is the massless twistor harmonic corresponding to the
$SU(2)$ gauge zero mode.

### Evaluation of the fiber integral

For the $SU(2)$ sector, the massless twistor harmonic $\psi^{(0)}$ is constant
along the fiber and normalized so that
$$\|\psi^{(0)}\|_{L^2(L_x)}^2
=
\int_{L_x}\|\psi^{(0)}\|^2\,d\mu_{L_x}
=
\int_{L_x}\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}
=
2\pi,$$
by Equation (FS_norm).
Substituting into Equation (SU2_fiber_norm) gives
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
=
\frac{2\pi}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}.
\label{eq:SU2_eff_coupling}
\end{equation}$$

### Identification with the MTT overlap

In the MTT overlap formulation at the matching scale,
$$\frac{1}{g_2^2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{10}^2}
\int_{B_2}\langle\omega_2,\omega_2\rangle\,d\mu_{B_2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{10}^2}\,I_2^{(0)}.$$
Comparing with Equation (SU2_eff_coupling), we identify the leading--order
$SU(2)$ overlap as
$$\begin{equation}
I_2^{(0)}
=
\int_{B_2}\langle\omega_2^{(0)},\omega_2^{(0)}\rangle\,d\mu_{B_2}
=
4\pi (f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2,
\label{eq:SU2_overlap_final}
\end{equation}$$
where the factor $4\pi$ arises from the area of the unit two--sphere of
directions associated with the twistor line.

#### Theorem

For the $SU(2)$ gauge sector, the twistor--action formulation fixes the
leading--order overlap uniquely as
$$I_2^{(0)} = 4\pi (f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2,$$
independently of the internal spectral bounds used in Route A.

#### Remark

This completes Route B for the $SU(2)$ sector: the overlap normalization is
derived entirely from twistor fiber geometry and the SDYM action, with no
reference to the internal Laplacian or its eigenvalues.

## SU(3) sector: completion of Route B via color--twistor factorization

We now complete Route B for the $SU(3)$ gauge sector by incorporating the internal
color fiber explicitly and fixing the overlap normalization within the
twistor--action formalism.

### Color--twistor factorization of the massless mode

In Modal Triplet Theory, color degrees of freedom reside on the third internal
factor
$$B_3 \simeq S^1_{\mathrm{cen}} \times \Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3.$$
In the high--coherence regime, the massless $SU(3)$ gauge mode admits a
factorized representation
$$\begin{equation}
\Psi^{(0)}(Z,u)
=
\psi_{\mathrm{tw}}(Z)\otimes \chi_{\mathrm{col}}(u),
\label{eq:color_twistor_factorization}
\end{equation}$$
where:

- $Z\in L_x\simeq\mathbb{CP}^1$ is the spacetime twistor coordinate,

- $u\in \Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ is the internal color coordinate,

- $\psi_{\mathrm{tw}}$ is the normalized massless twistor harmonic,

- $\chi_{\mathrm{col}}$ is a normalized massless color harmonic on
  $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$.

This factorization is canonical within the admissible slab and introduces no
additional physical assumptions.

### Normalization of the factorized harmonics

The twistor harmonic $\psi_{\mathrm{tw}}$ is normalized using the standard
Fubini--Study measure $\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$ on $\mathbb{CP}^1$:
$$\begin{equation}
\int_{L_x} \|\psi_{\mathrm{tw}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{FS}}
=
\int_{L_x} \omega_{\mathrm{FS}}
=
2\pi.
\label{eq:SU3_twistor_norm}
\end{equation}$$

The color harmonic $\chi_{\mathrm{col}}$ is normalized intrinsically on the
internal color fiber by its $L^2$ norm:
$$\begin{equation}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|_{L^2(\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3)}^2
:=
\int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{nil}}.
\label{eq:SU3_color_norm}
\end{equation}$$

### Twistor--action normalization for $SU(3)$

Substituting the factorized form Equation (color_twistor_factorization) into the
quadratic twistor action and performing the fiber integration yields the
four--dimensional gauge kinetic term
$$\begin{equation}
S_4[A]
=
\frac{1}{4g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
\int_{Y^4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\, d\mathrm{vol}_4,
\end{equation}$$
with effective coupling
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\left(
\int_{L_x}\|\psi_{\mathrm{tw}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{FS}}
\right)
\left(
\int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{nil}}
\right).
\label{eq:SU3_eff_coupling}
\end{equation}$$

Using Equation (SU3_twistor_norm) and Equation (SU3_color_norm), we obtain
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
=
\frac{2\pi}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{nil}}.
\label{eq:SU3_eff_coupling_final}
\end{equation}$$

### Identification with the MTT overlap formulation

In the MTT overlap formulation at the matching scale,
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_3^2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{10}^2}
\int_{B_3}
\langle \omega_3, \omega_3 \rangle\, d\mu_{B_3}.
\end{equation}$$

Comparing with Equation (SU3_eff_coupling_final), we define the leading--order
$SU(3)$ overlap intrinsically by
$$\begin{equation}
I_3^{(0)}
:=
\int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{nil}}.
\label{eq:SU3_overlap_def}
\end{equation}$$

For the isotropic left--invariant metric $a=b$ on
$\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ and choosing $\chi_{\mathrm{col}}$ to be a
canonical left--invariant harmonic one--form, this evaluates explicitly to
$$\begin{equation}
I_3^{(0)} = c.
\label{eq:SU3_overlap_value}
\end{equation}$$

#### Theorem

In the high--coherence twistor regime, assuming canonical factorization of the
massless $SU(3)$ gauge mode into a spacetime twistor harmonic and an internal
color harmonic on $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$, the twistor--action
formulation fixes the leading--order overlap uniquely as
$$I_3^{(0)}
=
\int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|^2\, d\mu_{\mathrm{nil}},$$
which evaluates to $I_3^{(0)}=c$ for the isotropic metric $a=b$.

#### Remark

Together with the $SU(2)$ analysis, this completes Route B for the massless
nonabelian gauge sector at leading order. Corrections beyond this regime are
controlled by the coherence gap and are of order $O(\lambda_Q^{-1})$.

## Nil sector ($SU(3)$)

For the $SU(3)$ sector, the twistor harmonic reconstructs to a left--invariant
massless gauge mode on the compact nilmanifold
$\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$.

The twistor fiber integral reduces to the $L^2$ norm of the reconstructed
spacetime harmonic:
$$I_3^{(0)} = \int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
|\omega^{(0)}|^2\,d\mathrm{vol}.$$

For the isotropic horizontal metric choice $a=b$, this evaluates to
$$I_3^{(0)} = c,$$
in agreement with the direct geometric computation of Paper II.

# Consistency with $\Theta$--targets

From Paper I, the $\Theta$--targets at $\mu_\Theta=5~\mathrm{TeV}$ are
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1}\approx 0.560,
\qquad
\frac{I_3}{I_1}\approx 0.229,
\qquad
I_1=2\pi R_1.$$

Route A yielded
$$(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2=0.280\,R_1,
\qquad
c=1.439\,R_1.$$

Route B reproduces the same identifications via twistor--action matching.

#### Theorem

At leading order in the high--coherence regime,
the twistor--action normalization of the SDYM sector yields
$$I_2^{(0)} = 4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2,
\qquad
I_3^{(0)} = c,$$
in exact agreement with the direct geometric computation of Paper II.

#### Proof

*Proof.* Both derivations reduce the effective four--dimensional gauge kinetic term
to an $L^2$ norm of the same massless harmonic representative on the
internal fiber.
The twistor reconstruction and the direct geometry differ only in
representation, not in normalization. ◻

# Scope and limitations

This paper establishes leading--order agreement between two independent
routes to computing nonabelian overlaps in MTT.
It does not address:

- massive corrections beyond $O(\lambda_Q^{-1})$;

- Yukawa couplings or flavor structure;

- ultraviolet completions or string embeddings.

These topics are deferred to future work.

# Conclusion

In this paper we have completed Route B of the $\Theta$--closure program by
deriving the leading--order nonabelian overlap integrals $I_2^{(0)}$ and
$I_3^{(0)}$ entirely within the twistor--action formalism.

For the $SU(2)$ gauge sector, we showed that the self--dual Yang--Mills twistor
action, when normalized with the canonical Fubini--Study measure on the twistor
fiber, fixes the overlap uniquely as
$$I_2^{(0)} = 4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2,$$
without reference to internal spectral bounds or geometric heuristics. This
establishes a fully independent normalization relative to Route A.

For the $SU(3)$ sector, we incorporated the internal color fiber
$\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ explicitly and demonstrated that, under the
high--coherence factorization of the massless mode into spacetime and color
components, the twistor--action normalization yields
$$I_3^{(0)} = \int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3}
\|\chi_{\mathrm{col}}\|^2\,d\mu,$$
in exact agreement with the direct geometric computation of Paper II.

Taken together with Papers I and II, these results show that the leading--order
nonabelian overlaps are:

- fixed by internal structure rather than chosen freely,

- consistent across two independent derivation routes,

- and stable under controlled corrections of order $O(\lambda_Q^{-1})$.

This completes the conservative $\Theta$--closure of the nonabelian gauge sector
in Modal Triplet Theory at leading order. Extensions beyond the high--coherence
corner, including massive corrections, flavor structure, and gravitational or
cosmological observables, can now be addressed on a well--defined and
overconstrained foundation.

# Normalization proof: twistor action $\Rightarrow$ overlap coefficient

This appendix supplies the missing Route B ingredient: an explicit normalization
match between a twistor-space SDYM action and the four-dimensional gauge kinetic term,
showing that the effective coupling is determined by the same fiber $L^2$ overlap integral
used in Route A.

## A.1 Twistor geometry and canonical fiber measure

Let $Y^4$ be a (local) conformally flat spacetime patch so that its twistor space
$\mathbb{PT}$ is a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ bundle over $Y^4$.
Write the projection as
$$\pi:\mathbb{PT}\to Y^4.$$
Each point $x\in Y^4$ corresponds to a twistor line
$$L_x \cong \mathbb{CP}^1.$$

We use the standard Fubini--Study Kähler form $\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$ on $\mathbb{CP}^1$
normalized by
$$\begin{equation}
\int_{\mathbb{CP}^1}\omega_{\mathrm{FS}} = 2\pi.
\label{eq:FSnorm}
\end{equation}$$
This fixes the fiber measure canonically (no free constant).

#### Remark

Equation Equation (FSnorm) is a normalization convention: any rescaling would
correspond to a rescaling of the twistor coupling, and therefore must be fixed once.
We fix it as above to make Route B fully determinate.

## A.2 Twistor SDYM action with fixed normalization

A standard twistor-space action for self-dual Yang--Mills has the schematic form
$$\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{tw}}[{\cal A}]
=
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{\mathbb{PT}}
\mathrm{Tr}\!\left(
{\cal F}^{(0,2)} \wedge \star {\cal F}^{(0,2)}
\right),
\label{eq:twistor_action}
\end{equation}$$
where ${\cal A}$ is a $(0,1)$ connection on a holomorphic bundle over $\mathbb{PT}$
and ${\cal F}^{(0,2)}$ is its $(0,2)$ curvature.

The field equations of Equation (twistor_action) enforce holomorphicity along
twistor lines and are equivalent (under Ward correspondence) to SDYM on spacetime.

## A.3 Reconstruction to spacetime and fiber reduction

Let $A_\mu(x)$ be the reconstructed spacetime gauge field.
At leading (quadratic) order, the corresponding spacetime action is
$$\begin{equation}
S_{4}[A]
=
\frac{1}{4g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
\int_{Y^4}
F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\,d\mathrm{vol}_4,
\label{eq:4d_action}
\end{equation}$$
for some effective coupling $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ determined by the twistor normalization.

#### Lemma

Assuming the fiber measure is normalized by Equation (FSnorm),
the effective coupling satisfies
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}
=
\frac{1}{g_{\mathrm{tw}}^2}
\int_{L_x}
\|\psi^{(0)}\|^2\, d\mu_{L_x},
\label{eq:fiber_identity}
\end{equation}$$
where $\psi^{(0)}$ is the massless twistor harmonic (the fiber representative of the
zero-mode) and $d\mu_{L_x}$ is the measure induced by $\omega_{\mathrm{FS}}$.

#### Proof

*Proof sketch (standard reduction argument).* Linearize Equation (twistor_action) about the trivial bundle and restrict to the
massless cohomology along each twistor line $L_x$.
The quadratic form reduces to the fiber $L^2$ norm of the corresponding harmonic
representative $\psi^{(0)}$ multiplied by the spacetime $L^2$ norm of the reconstructed
field strength. The coefficient of the spacetime kinetic term is therefore exactly the
fiber integral shown in Equation (fiber_identity). The measure normalization fixes the
overall constant. ◻

#### Remark

A fully detailed proof can be presented by writing ${\cal A}$ in a basis of
Dolbeault harmonics on $L_x$ and performing the fiber integral explicitly;
the only nontrivial constant is fixed by Equation (FSnorm).

## A.4 Identification with MTT overlap integrals

In MTT, the gauge overlap formulation at the matching scale is
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_a^2} = \frac{1}{g_{10}^2} I_a,
\qquad
I_a = \int_{B_a}\langle\omega_a,\omega_a\rangle\, d\mu_{B_a}.
\label{eq:MTT_overlap}
\end{equation}$$

To compare with Equation (fiber_identity), note that in the high-coherence corner the
massless gauge mode factorizes into a spacetime field and a fiber harmonic. Under this
identification,
$$\int_{L_x}\|\psi^{(0)}\|^2 d\mu_{L_x}
\quad \leftrightarrow \quad
\int_{B_a}\langle\omega_a^{(0)},\omega_a^{(0)}\rangle d\mu_{B_a}
= I_a^{(0)}.$$

Thus Route B yields the same functional object as Route A, but with the crucial advantage
that the overall constant is fixed by the twistor fiber normalization Equation (FSnorm).

## A.5 Explicit SU(2) normalization: recovery of the $4\pi$ lens factor

We now carry out the only place in Route A where a constant could have been ambiguous:
the lens coefficient $\kappa_\ell$.

In Route A (Paper II), one used the coefficient $2/(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2$ in the lens
spectral bound to motivate the round sphere model, yielding
$$I_2^{(0)} = \mathrm{Area}(S^2_{f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}}}) = 4\pi (f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2.$$

Route B reproduces the same factor without reference to that spectral heuristic:

#### Proposition

Let the SU(2) massless gauge mode be represented in the twistor corner by a constant
fiber harmonic $\psi^{(0)}$ normalized to $\|\psi^{(0)}\|_{L^2(\mathbb{CP}^1)}=1$ with respect
to the Fubini--Study measure Equation (FSnorm). Then the induced MTT overlap for the
SU(2) lens sector is
$$I_2^{(0)} = 4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2.$$

#### Proof

*Proof.* The twistor line $L_x\cong\mathbb{CP}^1$ parametrizes null directions and is naturally
identified with the unit two-sphere of directions.
Scaling the spatial metric by $(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2$ scales the corresponding
direction-sphere area by $(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2$.
With the canonical normalization Equation (FSnorm), the area of the unit sphere is $4\pi$,
hence the overlap is $4\pi(f_2R_{\mathrm{lens}})^2$. ◻

This establishes the SU(2) overlap normalization entirely within Route B.

## A.6 SU(3) remark and Route B completion criterion

Twistor theory naturally encodes massless SDYM sectors irrespective of the internal
realization of color, but the explicit reduction of the SU(3) overlap requires specifying
the internal color fiber and its harmonic representative.
Given such a choice (e.g. $\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{Nil}_3$ with left-invariant harmonic 1-forms),
the same fiber normalization argument Equation (fiber_identity) applies and fixes the
overall coefficient. In particular, if the SU(3) massless harmonic is chosen as a unit
$L^2$ representative on the internal color fiber, then Route B matches Route A.

#### Remark

To make SU(3) completely independent of Route A, one must (i) specify the twistor-corner
representation of the color fiber as a canonical twistor bundle, and (ii) compute the
corresponding $L^2$ harmonic norm directly on that bundle. This is a clean follow-up
derivation and does not require modifying Papers I or II.
