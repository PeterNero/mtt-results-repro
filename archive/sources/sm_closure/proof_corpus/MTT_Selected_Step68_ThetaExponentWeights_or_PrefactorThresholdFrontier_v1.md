# MTT Selected Step68 ThetaExponentWeights or PrefactorThresholdFrontier v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_STEP68_THETA_EXPONENT_WEIGHTS_CLOSED_PREFACTOR_THRESHOLD_FRONTIER_OPEN`.

## What Closed

Step68 closes the exponent-weight tier of the scalar-row problem:

```text
epsilon_Theta                         : exp(-2*pi)
family gap ratios                     : [-2, -1, 1]
qutrit quotient floor                 : 2/3
Higgs shared-line exponent shell      : 1/3
charged exponent rows emitted         : 9
magnitude weights closed, exponent tier: true
accepted Omega source rows            : 0
accepted internal scalar values        : 0
lambda_H value row emitted             : false
true SM equivalence closed             : false
full no-knob closure                   : false
```

The selected family spectrum supplies the integer ladder `(-2,-1,+1)`.  The
selected theta overlap anchor supplies `epsilon_Theta`.  The adjacent Qa/SU3
quotient-projector theorem supplies the non-fit qutrit/shared-circle index
`Tr(P_perp)/Tr(I_3)=2/3`, and the shared line gives the `1/3` Higgs exponent
shell.  No measured Yukawa, Higgs, CKM, or mass value is used as a selector.

## Boundary

The exponent rows are not full scalar rows.  They still need selected
HYM/threshold prefactor rows, same-branch threshold and mass-scheme source rows,
the true precision convention/profile clause, and the sector/full-S2 operator
payload before the strict Omega validator can accept value rows.
