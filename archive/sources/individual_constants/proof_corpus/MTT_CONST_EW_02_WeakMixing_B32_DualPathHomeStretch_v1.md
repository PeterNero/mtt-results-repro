# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B32 Dual Path Home Stretch v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B32_DUAL_PATH_HOME_STRETCH_BUILT`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B32-SAMESOURCE-EMISSION-OR-ACTUAL-ROWPACKET`

## Tried Both Paths

```text
Route A actual same-source Phi_fin/b emission validates      False
Route B actual independent row-source packet validates       False
Route A conditional witness validates                       True
Route B conditional witness validates                       True
Route B table shape ready                                   True
```

## What This Means

This removes the last numerical-search ambiguity. The blocker is source
promotion only.

## Home-Stretch Contract

Route A must emit:

```text
physical action restriction to finite Weyl quotient
zero extra boundary/source term
phase R_Z source selection
shift R_X source selection
same-source b_selected emission
```

Route B must emit:

```text
selected basis-to-row functional theorem for all 72 primitive rows
pre-residual phase/shift variation operators
independent Hessian counterterm/source rows
sector rows assembled from those source rows
no residual-projector replay or locked-target values as source
```
