# Marked-Poisson Actualization Frontier Report

Date: 2026-07-23

## Result

The selected q79 recorder hazards now have an exact constructive
one-stochastic-primitive completion.

One Poisson random measure on
\[
\mathbb R_+\times S^1_{\rm shared}
\]
with intensity \(\gamma_Cdt\otimes m_{\rm Haar}\) supplies objective event
times and marks. Partitioning the mark circle by the already-derived
normalized hazards gives independent cause-specific clocks with rates
\(\gamma_C\|M_{C,a}z\|^2\). Their first record has exactly the quadratic
weight, and integration over upper preparations gives
\[
\Pr(a)=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho E_a).
\]

The compact circle is only the mark carrier. Physical time remains the
noncompact \(\mathbb R_+\) coordinate.

## What Improved

The abstract candidate `A_Born` fixed probability descent but did not supply
actual event trajectories. The new candidate

```text
A_PRM: shared-circle marked Poisson actualization
```

is stronger: it supplies waiting times, cause labels, counting paths,
coarse-graining and SecondMomentCaptureDescent with one structural stochastic
primitive and no numerical parameters.

This is stronger only in operational output, not in logical economy. The
quadratic intensity assignment is an explicit clause of `A_PRM`; the Poisson
theorem turns it into paths but does not derive it from deterministic MTT
geometry.

## No-Go Preserved

This does not rehabilitate arbitrary threshold dilation. Constant-speed circle
traversal has an atom at zero and bounded conditional first-entry time, so it
cannot be a positive-rate memoryless clock. Haar phase alone remains
insufficient.

## Status

`B.QM.01` remains open at the selected-source tier. Current MTT has neither
derived nor adopted Poisson independent increments, and the full physical
apparatus configuration map is still open.

The exact gain is a sharply specified fallback:

```text
zero-primitive source: open
one-stochastic-primitive actualization: exact and constructive
continuous/discrete numerical knobs added: zero
```
