  We test the strongest string/QM-inspired continuation of the Iwasawa route:
  the qutrit projective magnetic carrier.  Its finite arithmetic is clean.  The
  clock/shift relation XZ = omega ZX gives a nontrivial F_3^2 projective
  2-cocycle with nondegenerate alternating commutator form, equivalently the
  finite Heisenberg group H_3.  The MTT string/flux corpus also contains the
  right kind of source infrastructure: B-fields as Deligne 2-gerbe connections,
  global Hhat curvature, Green-Schwarz Bianchi identities, fixed
  topological/gerbe sectors, heterotic gerbe quantization, Freed-Witten
  consistency, Fu-Yau Bianchi-compatible sectors, and the rule that twisted
  bundle carriers must be retained by a spectral projector.  What is not yet
  present is the actual selected map from the zeta_3 central corner cocycle to
  the fixed MTT gerbe/B-field/Bianchi data.  Therefore the route is promoted
  from attractive prototype to a precise open gate, not to selected SM closure.

# Purpose

The projective magnetic carrier and projective rho_E validator now prove a
limited but real fact:

```text
ordinary vector-bundle gluing fails,
projective central-phase gluing succeeds.
```

The next question is sharper:

```text
does MTT select this central twist,
or is it only a good mathematical prototype?
```

# Finite Cocycle Arithmetic

The carrier uses qutrit clock and shift matrices:

```text
X Z = omega Z X,
omega^3 = 1.
```

Writing:

```text
U_(a,b) = X^a Z^b,  (a,b) in F_3^2,
```

the multiplication law is:

```text
U_x U_y = omega^c(x,y) U_(x+y),
c((a,b),(a',b')) = -a' b mod 3.
```

The alternating commutator form is:

```text
B((a,b),(a',b')) = a b' - a' b mod 3.
```

On the standard basis its matrix is:

```text
[[0, 1],
 [2, 0]]
```

This has rank `2` over `F_3`, so the cocycle is not a coboundary.  Equivalently
the carrier is the nontrivial finite Heisenberg central extension:

```text
1 -> Z_3 -> H_3 -> F_3^2 -> 1.
```

This is exactly the finite QM/magnetic-translation structure one would expect
from a discrete B-field or gerbe twist.

# Corpus Alignment

The string/flux corpus contains the right source category:

```text
B-field as Deligne 2-gerbe connection,
global gauge-invariant Hhat,
Chern-Simons covariance,
fixed topological Chern/gerbe sector,
Green-Schwarz Bianchi identity,
heterotic gerbe flux quantization,
Iwasawa componentwise Bianchi support,
Freed-Witten global consistency,
Fu-Yau Bianchi-compatible sector.
```

The earlier twisted-equivariant Z64 note also gives the correct guardrail:

```text
a twisted bundle carrier is admissible only if the spectral projector retains
the selected character sector.
```

Finally, the existing Mukai fixed-sector descent already has an ambient
family-Z3 slot:

```text
Z_1344 -> Z_448
```

with the family kernel removed from the selected q79 branch.  That makes the
qutrit twist a plausible family/twisted-boundary carrier, not a replacement for
the closed q79 character.

# What Is Still Missing

The corpus does not yet provide the selected map:

```text
zeta_3 central corner cocycle
  -> Deligne/Cech gerbe representative
  -> B-field/Hhat periods
  -> Green-Schwarz Bianchi residual
  -> retained twisted sector projector
  -> selected twisted D_E and dotD response.
```

This is the exact missing proof object.

# Verdict

The projective route is now better than a guess:

```text
finite cocycle arithmetic closes,
projective rho_E validation closes,
string/flux source category aligns.
```

But it is not yet selected:

```text
selected projective twist source = not found.
```

# Correct Next Gate

The correct next object is a twisted-source promotion gate.

It should accept a candidate only if it supplies:

```text
1. a Deligne/Cech gerbe or B-field period representative;
2. a map from that representative to the zeta_3 central corner cocycle;
3. a Bianchi and Freed-Witten compatibility certificate;
4. twisted sector projectors retained by the coherent spectral projector;
5. selected rho_E tables passing the projective mesh and metric validators;
6. selected D_E, Riesz, Green, dotD, and primitive C1 contractions.
```

Only after those pass can this projective branch start computing Yukawa
matrices or SM masses.  The closed q79 branch remains untouched.
