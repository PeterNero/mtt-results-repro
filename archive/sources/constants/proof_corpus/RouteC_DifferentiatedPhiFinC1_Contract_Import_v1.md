# RouteC Differentiated PhiFinC1 Contract Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_DIFFERENTIATED_PHIFINC1_CONTRACT_IMPORTED_LANES_OPEN`.

The dynamic C1 blocker is now a two-lane contract:

```text
Lane A: residual-projector axiom/theorem insertion
Lane B: honest selected Galerkin C1 execution
```

The implication replay is exact:

```text
rank = 2
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

Neither lane is selected yet.  The residual-projector axiom is not inserted,
the differentiated `Phi_fin^C1` application rule is not proved, and honest
Galerkin C1 values are not emitted.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_ResidualProjectorAxiomInsertion_or_GalerkinC1FirstExecution_v1`.
