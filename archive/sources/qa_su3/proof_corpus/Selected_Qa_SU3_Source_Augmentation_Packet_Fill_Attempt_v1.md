# Selected Qa/SU3 Source Augmentation Packet Fill Attempt v1

## Purpose

This artifact attempts to fill the Iwasawa monad-map source-augmentation packet from the current corpus before any comparison with the `Qa/SU3` residual.

## What the Source Fills

The heterotic Iwasawa source supplies:

```text
source paper present: yes
Iwasawa quotient notation: yes
left-invariant ansatz: yes
rank-3 SU3 monad topology: yes
generic holomorphic maps named: yes
constant matrices in a left-invariant frame named: yes
Li-Yau/HYM source-level existence claim named: yes
target fitting used: no
```

This is useful, but it is still not the validator packet.

## The Block

The fill attempt identifies the exact mismatch:

```text
source statement:
generic holomorphic maps as constant matrices in the left-invariant frame

why not enough:
the packet needs global sections of nonzero-charge line bundles F_i and G_i,
constant local-frame entries do not specify a non-flat factor of automorphy,
without section bases and products, g*f=0 is not a machine-checkable scalar relation,
without Cech/Dolbeault/rho_E/D_E data, no finite determinant can be computed.
```

The current source still does not print:

```text
complex coordinate action of Gamma,
lattice generators,
charge-to-factor map q -> a_q(gamma,z),
cocycle and c1 realization checks,
section dimensions and bases for F1..F5, G1..G5, P,
product constants m_i,
numeric f,g coefficients,
operator exit.
```

## Validator

For the current template:

```text
validator exit code: 2
validator output: OPEN: packet status is open
```

## Verdict

```text
partial source packet built: yes
source certificate filled: yes
geometry partially filled: yes
automorphy filled: no
section ring filled: no
explicit f,g constructed: no
g*f=0 checked: no
operator exit available: no
determinant computable now: no
Qa/SU3 closed: no
target fitting used: no
```

## Next

The next decision is no longer broad search. It is a three-way repair choice:

```text
1. amend/source the Iwasawa factor-of-automorphy and section-ring data,
2. replace the monad-map route with a source-certified D_E/rho_E operator exit,
3. switch to the projective gerbe/Chan-Paton route if the non-flat ordinary line-bundle packet is not source-selected.
```
