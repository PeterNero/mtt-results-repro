## A_EW Slot Execution

The legal Higgs metrology slots were executed against the current source and
external WZH data:

```text
A_EW(M_t) external = 0.0685013467625
A_EW recomputed    = 0.0685013467625
s_beta             = 0.004701083905943647
lambda_Dterm       = 0.00032203057880065373
lambda_Mt external = 0.12604
```

Result:

```text
selected A_EW value                  false
selected mu_match value              false
selected threshold/RG transport      false
selected metrology source slots      0
```

The WZH rows are available as external benchmark coordinates, but they remain
external coordinates, not selected source rows.

## Burden Equivalence Diagnostic

The external diagnostic burden is:

```text
lambda_Mt / (A_EW*s_beta) = 391.39140285811936
UP_RET_OVERLAP.HRG        = 391.39140285811936
residual                  = 0.0
```

This is important because the A_EW route and the HRG route point to the same
large threshold factor.  It is not closure because the equality uses the
external Higgs quartic coordinate.

## HRG Non-Higgs Selector

The HRG non-Higgs selector execution ranks the lanes:

```text
1. alpha/source-strength      nearest selector, not accepted yet
2. dynamic C1 overlap tensor  valid fallback, more missing payload
3. charged scalar thresholds  rejected: T_scheme=1 already selected
4. generic non-Higgs RG       rejected until typed consumer exists
```

Accepted same-HRG non-Higgs prediction maps:

```text
0
```
