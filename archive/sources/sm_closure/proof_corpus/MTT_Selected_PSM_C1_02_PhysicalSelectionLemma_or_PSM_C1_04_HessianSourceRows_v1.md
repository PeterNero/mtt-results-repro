# MTT Selected PSM-C1-02 Physical Selection Lemma or PSM-C1-04 Hessian Source Rows v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PSM_C1_02_PHYSICALSELECTIONLEMMA_OR_PSM_C1_04_HESSIANSOURCEROWS_BUILT_CONDITIONAL_THREE_FIELD_ROUTEB`

## Theorem

**ConditionalSelectionHessianCompressionTheorem.** For the post-SM-parity Route-B C1 gate, the best current unpatched state closes only selected_basis_feeds_all_72_row_functionals. If the already isolated physical-selection lemma for R_Z/R_X and the same-source Hessian/b-vector row principle are accepted conditionally, then three of five strict Route-B fields are true and the validator reduces to sector-row assembly plus replay-independence. This is a compression of the remaining proof, not an unpatched closure.

## Result

- Unpatched Route B still has only one strict field closed: `selected_basis_feeds_all_72_row_functionals`.
- Conditionally, the local Weyl-variation/Hessian spine promotes `PSM-C1-02` and `PSM-C1-04`, giving 3 of 5 Route-B fields.
- The strict validator still fails under that conditional compression because `sector_rows_assembled_from_source_rows` and `no_residual_projector_replay_or_locked_target_as_source` remain false.
- This does not reopen SM-parity and does not claim no-knob closure.

## Superset Use

The superset strategy is doing real work here: Route B row kernels, Route A physical source emission, and the local Weyl-variation/Hessian principle are fused only as a conditional diagnostic. The locked target is constrained, but promotion remains legal only when same-branch source emission or replay-independent provenance is supplied.

## Next Artifact

`MTT_Selected_PSM_C1_06_SectorRows_or_ReplayIndependenceCertificate_v1`

Next target: either assemble `PSM-C1-06` sector rows from the source rows, or prove the replay-independence certificate. In parallel, backfill the unpatched source theorem for `PSM-C1-02` and `PSM-C1-04`.
