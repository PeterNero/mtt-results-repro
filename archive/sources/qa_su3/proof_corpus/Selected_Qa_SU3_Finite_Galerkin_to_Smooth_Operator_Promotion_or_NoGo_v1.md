# Selected Qa/SU3 Finite Galerkin to Smooth Operator Promotion or No-Go v1

## Verdict

The finite Galerkin candidate is preserved, but it does not yet promote to full
smooth Qa/SU3 closure.

```text
promotes now: False
current-source no-go: True
```

## Conditional Promotion Theorem

If the selected smooth Qa/SU3 Hessian on the twisted source sector factors as:

```text
H_smooth|charge = Q^T W Q
```

and the same source selects `W=I` on the eleven typed labels, then the validated
finite block promotes:

```text
H_sel = [[26, -3, 0], [-3, 10, 0], [0, 0, 8]]
G_ret = [['10/251', '3/251', 0], ['3/251', '26/251', 0], [0, 0, '1/8']]
Pi_tw = [0, 0, 1]
```

The proof is now exact and short: `Q^T Q` is the computed block, its inverse is
the computed retarded Green kernel, and the primitive twisted `P`-annihilator
minimization selects `+e3`, which gives the existing `tau` table.

## Why It Does Not Promote Yet

The current corpus supports Galerkin approximation, positive Hessian/coercivity,
and Tier-2 modal-democracy language.  But those do not by themselves prove that
the Qa/SU3 smooth threshold operator has:

```text
same-source operator: no
charge factorization Q^T W Q: no
source-selected W=I or exact W: no
determinant finite part: no
```

Modal democracy is useful as a candidate symmetry assumption, but in the current
source record it is not a same-branch Qa/SU3 operator-source theorem.

## Weighted Hessian Gate

The correct next object is not just another unweighted calculation.  A smooth
operator can change the block to:

```text
H(W)=Q^T W Q
```

with source-selected weights `W`.  Arbitrary weights can change `G_ret` and mix
the `c` axis with `K1/K2`, so the `+e3` selector must either be rederived for
the selected `W`, or `W=I` must be proved from the same source.

## Next Artifact

```text
Selected_Qa_SU3_Weighted_Hessian_Source_or_Same_Source_Operator_Solve_v1
```

That artifact should either supply a selected weight metric/operator packet and
recompute the weighted Hessian, or prove that no current source can provide it.
