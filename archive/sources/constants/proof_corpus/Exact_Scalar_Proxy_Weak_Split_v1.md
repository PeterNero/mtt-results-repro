# Exact Scalar-Proxy Weak Split v1

## Purpose

The C1 response interface gives:

```text
lambda_12 = p_U1 - p_SU2.
```

Therefore the `SU3`/Nil determinant is not needed for the weak `1-2` split.
It may matter for other threshold questions, but it is not the last gate for
`Delta_G_12`.

## Exact Scalar-Proxy Result

From the exact circle/sphere zeta pieces:

```text
p_U1  =  2.442340583291322,
p_SU2 = -0.5980970589159109.
```

Thus:

```text
lambda_12 = p_U1 - p_SU2
          = 3.040437642207233.
```

Using:

```text
v1_tilde = 0.405623467693425,
Delta_G_12 = v1_tilde lambda_12/(4 pi),
```

we get:

```text
Delta_G_12 = 0.09817897696895524.
```

## Comparison To Diagnostic Target

The old diagnostic fixture required:

```text
lambda_12 = 2.194153126940556,
Delta_G_12 = 0.07082394967589342.
```

The exact scalar-proxy/unit-weight result has residual:

```text
residual lambda_12 = 0.8462845152666772,
residual Delta_G_12 = 0.02735502729306182.
```

So the scalar-proxy/unit-weight determinant is not the final electroweak
threshold operator.

## Consequence

The remaining gate is no longer the Nil determinant for the weak split.  It is:

```text
Selected_U1_SU2_Gauge_Threshold_Operator_and_Weights_v1.
```

That artifact must decide whether the scalar Laplacian proxy is the correct
operator, and must supply topology-certified `U1` and `SU2` index weights.

## Verdict

Closed:

```text
exact scalar-proxy U1-SU2 zeta split.
```

Open:

```text
selected gauge-threshold operator and weights.
```
