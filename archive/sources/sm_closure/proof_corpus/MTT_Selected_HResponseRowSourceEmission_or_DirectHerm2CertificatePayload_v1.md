# MTT Selected HResponseRowSourceEmission or DirectHerm2CertificatePayload v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_HRESPONSEROWSOURCEEMISSION_OR_DIRECTHERM2CERTIFICATEPAYLOAD_SUPPORT_SPLIT_PRIMITIVE_FORMULA_OPEN`

## Theorem

The certificate layer is now split correctly:

- `B_Huv` source IDs/provenance: `True`
- `B_Huv` finite exactness support: `True`
- `B_Huv` quotient support: `{'kernel_is_span_Hu_minus_Hd_dagger': True, 'q_Hu_equals_q_Hd_dagger': True, 'q_restricted_to_each_B_Huv_column_nonzero': True, 'q_times_kernel_is_zero': True}`
- Herm(2) codomain/extractor support: `True`

These are support certificates.  They do not by themselves emit final row
certificates for `Huu,Hud_re,Hud_im,Hdd`, because the source-owned primitive
H-sector row formula and finite row-level exactness/error bound are still
absent.

Current execution:

- required payload slots: `8`
- support slots available: `4`
- accepted final payload slots: `0`
- accepted value rows: `0`
- accepted final certificates: `0`
