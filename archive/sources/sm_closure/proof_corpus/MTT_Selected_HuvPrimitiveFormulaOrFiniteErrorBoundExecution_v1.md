# MTT Selected HuvPrimitiveFormula or FiniteErrorBoundExecution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_HUVPRIMITIVEFORMULA_OR_FINITEERRORBOUNDEXECUTION_UNDERDETERMINED_SOURCE_FUNCTIONAL_OPEN`

## Theorem

The direct closure attempt is now mathematically decided.

`B_Huv` fixes the selected source-orthonormal coordinate domain, but it does not
select the Herm(2) value operator.  On the same `B_Huv` support, both of these
non-scalar Herm(2) completions are compatible as formal value operators:

```text
diag(1,-1)  -> Huu=1, Hud=0, Hdd=-1
[[0,1],[1,0]] -> Huu=0, Hud=1, Hdd=0
```

They give different `Huu,Hud,Hdd` rows while sharing the same closed support
layer.  Therefore attaching `B_Huv` support cannot close the final row payload.

Closed here:

- primitive Huv formula execution contract
- explicit underdetermination witness against support-only closure
- recheck of current finite-H, `M_source`, and primitive/direct rows with `0`
  accepted values

Still required:

- selected finite H-sector functional `F_H`, or
- selected same-source Hermitian `M_source`, or
- selected primitive H-response kernel `K_H`,
- plus row-level exactness proof or rigorous finite error bound.
