# Canonical q79 Minimal Defect-Recorder Action and Collision Instrument Theorem

## Result

The selected q79 Reynolds pair
\[
P=P_{\rm Haar},
\qquad
Q=I-P
\]
fixes a gauge-unique minimal interaction shape for recording the `P/Q`
decomposition.

There are two distinct minimality statements:

1. a two-state pointer is minimal for a defect/no-defect Stinespring recorder;
2. a pointer with one ready state and two distinct stable `P/Q` records has
   minimum dimension three.

The three-state construction produces the exact q79 dephasing semigroup on
every repeated-interaction time grid and supplies its two quadratic
cause-specific capture hazards. The action-selection principle, physical rate
and realized-record probability law remain open.

## 1. q79 Input

On the finite complex-six carrier, the normalized Reynolds projector satisfies
\[
P^\ast=P,
\qquad
P^2=P,
\qquad
\operatorname{rank}P=2.
\]
Its complement satisfies
\[
Q^\ast=Q,
\qquad
Q^2=Q,
\qquad
\operatorname{rank}Q=4,
\qquad
PQ=0.
\]
Write
\[
Z=P-Q.
\]
Then \(Z^\ast=Z\) and \(Z^2=I\).

## 2. Minimal Recorder Selection Principle

Consider the candidate structural principle:

```text
A_rec: minimal unbiased nondemolition q79 recorder.
```

It imposes:

1. the interaction does not mix the `P` and `Q` sectors;
2. it is uniform inside each q79 sector;
3. the pointer contains one prepared ready state and the minimum number of
   orthogonal records required by the declared experiment;
4. the recorder has no diagonal pointer bias or independent system phase;
5. physical `P` and `Q` records have equal normalized coupling strength.

This is one structural principle and no numerical selector. It is not yet
derived from the selected upper MTT action.

## 3. Two-State Defect Recorder

Let the pointer be
\[
\mathcal K_2
=\operatorname{span}\{|r\rangle,|d\rangle\}
\]
and define
\[
Y_{rd}
=i(|d\rangle\langle r|-|r\rangle\langle d|).
\]
The interaction Hamiltonian is
\[
H_2=\kappa_C\,Q\otimes Y_{rd}.
\]

### Theorem 1: gauge uniqueness

Under the coherent-silent, defect-uniform, two-state, unbiased requirements,
every nonzero Hermitian recorder Hamiltonian is gauge-equivalent to \(H_2\),
up to its overall dimensional strength and orientation.

### Proof

Coherent silence and defect uniformity force
\[
H_{\rm int}=Q\otimes B.
\]
After removing a pointer-independent diagonal term, unbiasedness makes the
Hermitian matrix `B` off diagonal:
\[
B=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&\overline z\\
z&0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Normalization fixes \(|z|=1\). A diagonal pointer phase transformation,
which preserves both record projectors, sends `z` to `i`. Reversing orientation
changes the remaining sign. Hence all allowed actions lie in the displayed
gauge class.

### Exact dilation

For \(\theta=\kappa_Ct\),
\[
e^{-itH_2}
=P\otimes I+Q\otimes e^{-i\theta Y_{rd}}.
\]
Starting from \(|r\rangle\),
\[
U_\theta(z\otimes|r\rangle)
=(P+\cos\theta\,Q)z\otimes|r\rangle
+\sin\theta\,Qz\otimes|d\rangle.
\]
The selected physical pointer basis therefore gives
\[
K_r=P+\cos\theta\,Q,
\qquad
K_d=\sin\theta\,Q.
\]

At
\[
\cos\theta=\frac7{25},
\qquad
\sin\theta=\frac{24}{25},
\]
this recovers the previously certified informative q79 instrument exactly.
The random-unitary unravelling of the same nonselective channel is excluded by
`A_rec`: it does not produce a sector-informative defect record.

The two-state pointer has no separate finite-time `P` record. It distinguishes
an emitted defect record from its absence.

## 4. Minimum Three-State Capture Recorder

An apparatus with one ready state and two mutually orthogonal stable outcome
records requires at least three pointer dimensions. Let
\[
\mathcal K_3
=\operatorname{span}\{|r\rangle,|p\rangle,|q\rangle\}.
\]
Define
\[
Y_{rp}
=i(|p\rangle\langle r|-|r\rangle\langle p|),
\qquad
Y_{rq}
=i(|q\rangle\langle r|-|r\rangle\langle q|),
\]
and
\[
H_3
=\kappa_C
\left(
P\otimes Y_{rp}
+Q\otimes Y_{rq}
\right).
\]

The two summands commute because \(PQ=0\).

### Theorem 2: gauge uniqueness and minimality

Under `A_rec`, every ready/`P`/`Q` recorder is gauge-equivalent to \(H_3\), up
to its common dimensional strength and orientation. Pointer dimension three is
minimal.

### Proof

One prepared ready state and two mutually orthogonal record states are three
linearly independent vectors, proving the dimension lower bound.

Nondemolition sector control forces
\[
H_{\rm int}=P\otimes B_P+Q\otimes B_Q.
\]
The declared record graph permits `B_P` to connect only `r` with `p`, and
`B_Q` only `r` with `q`. Zero pointer bias removes diagonal terms. Hermiticity
therefore leaves one complex transition coefficient in each block. Equal
normalized response fixes their magnitudes. Independent diagonal phase
changes of \(|p\rangle\) and \(|q\rangle\), which preserve every record
projector, remove both phases. A common sign reverses interaction orientation.
The remaining representative is exactly \(H_3\).

### Theorem 3: exact capture instrument

Starting with the pointer in \(|r\rangle\),
\[
\begin{split}
U_\theta(z\otimes|r\rangle)
={}&\cos\theta\,z\otimes|r\rangle\\
&+\sin\theta\,Pz\otimes|p\rangle
+\sin\theta\,Qz\otimes|q\rangle.
\end{split}
\]
Consequently the action-selected instrument has Kraus maps
\[
K_r=\cos\theta\,I,
\qquad
K_p=\sin\theta\,P,
\qquad
K_q=\sin\theta\,Q.
\]
It is normalized:
\[
K_r^\ast K_r+K_p^\ast K_p+K_q^\ast K_q=I.
\]

### Proof

Let
\[
A_3=-iH_3/\kappa_C.
\]
On the ready-pointer subspace,
\[
A_3(z\otimes|r\rangle)
=Pz\otimes|p\rangle+Qz\otimes|q\rangle,
\]
and
\[
A_3^2(z\otimes|r\rangle)=-z\otimes|r\rangle.
\]
The exponential series therefore reduces to the displayed sine and cosine
rotation. Completeness follows from \(P+Q=I\).

### Stable record algebra

After each collision, the outgoing pointer decouples. Its algebra
\[
\mathfrak R_{\rm out}
=\operatorname{span}
\{
|r\rangle\langle r|,
|p\rangle\langle p|,
|q\rangle\langle q|
\}
\]
is atomic and commutative. With zero or record-diagonal post-collision pointer
dynamics, it remains invariant. Thus the action and apparatus context select a
physical record algebra rather than an abstract Kraus basis.

## 5. Exact Repeated-Interaction Semigroup

For a time step \(\Delta>0\), select the interaction angle by
\[
\cos^2\theta_\Delta=e^{-\gamma_C\Delta}.
\]
Use a fresh ready pointer at each step. Tracing one outgoing pointer gives
\[
\Phi_\Delta(\rho)
=e^{-\gamma_C\Delta}\rho
+(1-e^{-\gamma_C\Delta})
  (P\rho P+Q\rho Q).
\]
Equivalently,
\[
\Phi_\Delta(\rho)
=P\rho P+Q\rho Q
+e^{-\gamma_C\Delta}(P\rho Q+Q\rho P).
\]

### Theorem 4: grid exactness

For every integer \(n\geq0\),
\[
\Phi_\Delta^n=\Phi_{n\Delta}.
\]

### Proof

The diagonal `P/P` and `Q/Q` blocks are fixed by every step. Each cross block
is multiplied by \(e^{-\gamma_C\Delta}\). After `n` steps it is multiplied by
\(e^{-\gamma_Cn\Delta}\), proving the identity.

The continuous generator is
\[
\mathcal L_C(\rho)
=\gamma_C(P\rho P+Q\rho Q-\rho).
\]
Since
\[
P\rho P+Q\rho Q
=\frac12(\rho+Z\rho Z),
\]
this is exactly
\[
\mathcal L_C(\rho)
=\frac{\gamma_C}{2}(Z\rho Z-\rho).
\]
Thus the recorder action reproduces the already certified q79 dephasing
generator shape.

It also has the jump representation
\[
L_p=\sqrt{\gamma_C}\,P,
\qquad
L_q=\sqrt{\gamma_C}\,Q.
\]

## 6. Quadratic Capture Clocks

For a normalized preparation \(\psi\), the two cause-specific jump hazards are
\[
h_p(\psi)=\|L_p\psi\|^2
=\gamma_C\|P\psi\|^2,
\]
\[
h_q(\psi)=\|L_q\psi\|^2
=\gamma_C\|Q\psi\|^2.
\]
Their sum is \(\gamma_C\).

Therefore the first non-ready pointer time is exponentially distributed with
total rate \(\gamma_C\) in the standard quantum-trajectory realization, and
its label weights are proportional to the two exact quadratic responses.
This is precisely the mechanism required by the earlier
Quadratic-Hazard First-Capture Born Theorem.

For the first q79 carrier basis state,
\[
\|P e_1\|^2=\frac13,
\qquad
\|Q e_1\|^2=\frac23.
\]

At finite time \(t=n\Delta\), the three record effects are
\[
E_r(t)=e^{-\gamma_Ct}I,
\]
\[
E_p(t)=(1-e^{-\gamma_Ct})P,
\qquad
E_q(t)=(1-e^{-\gamma_Ct})Q.
\]
As \(t\to\infty\), the ready effect vanishes and the two record effects tend
exactly to `P` and `Q`.

This proves the capture-clock and instrument maps. It does not independently
derive the rule assigning probabilities to realized records. Using
\(\operatorname{Tr}(E_a\rho)\) at this point would import the Born trace rule
whose MTT source remains under investigation.

## 7. Finite-Environment No-Go

A fixed bounded Hamiltonian with one finite pointer does not generate the
irreversible semigroup for every continuous time.

For the actions above, the coherence attenuation is respectively
\(\cos(\kappa_Ct)\) or \(\cos^2(\kappa_Ct)\). Both have zero dissipative
derivative at \(t=0\). By contrast,
\[
\left.\frac{d}{dt}e^{-\gamma_Ct}\right|_{t=0}
=-\gamma_C
\]
for \(\gamma_C>0\). Hence no fixed finite-pointer realization of this form can
equal the positive-rate exponential on an interval.

For the repeated-interaction action,
\[
\theta_\Delta^2
=\gamma_C\Delta+O(\Delta^2),
\qquad
\frac{\theta_\Delta}{\Delta}
\sim\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_C}{\Delta}}.
\]
The continuous limit therefore has the standard singular weak-coupling or
quantum-noise scaling. A fresh pointer chain, Fock dilation or equivalent
controlled limit is required.

This agrees with established repeated-interaction mathematics: Attal and
Pautrat derive quantum stochastic dynamics from fresh ancilla chains, and
modern collision-model work connects such limits to Lindblad generators and
quantum trajectories:

- [Attal and Pautrat, From repeated to continuous quantum interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0311002)
- [Ciccarello et al., Quantum collision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11974)
- [Grimmer et al., Open dynamics under rapid repeated interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04302)

Those results supply the general limiting technology. The MTT-specific datum
is the q79 `P/Q` sector geometry fixing the recorder coupling.

## 8. Selection and Parameter Ledger

If `A_rec` is adopted:

```text
new structural principles:             1
new universal dimensionless parameters: 0
new fitted parameters:                  0
new observed construction inputs:       0
inherited physical context rates:        1
```

The inherited rate is \(\gamma_C\). Its proposed gravitational value remains
\[
\gamma_C
=\frac{g_0E_0}{2\hbar}\mathcal J_C,
\]
but this identity is still the `B.COLLAPSE.01` source target.

## 9. Frontier Delta

Closed at the conditional action tier:

- the gauge class of the minimal two-state q79 defect recorder;
- the proof that finite two-sided capture needs a three-state pointer;
- the gauge class of the minimal ready/`P`/`Q` capture action;
- the stable outgoing record algebra;
- the informative instrument selected by that physical coupling;
- exact repeated-interaction semigroup composition;
- the quadratic `P/Q` jump hazards and capture-clock shape.

Still open:

1. derivation or explicit adoption of `A_rec` by upper MTT;
2. the selected profile-dependent value of \(\gamma_C\);
3. a controlled continuum field/Fock realization with domains and errors;
4. the realized-record probability law without importing Born weights;
5. extension from the canonical q79 context to every physical apparatus
   context.

Thus `B.QM.01` remains open. The canonical q79 instrument-action shape and
quadratic capture mechanism are no longer unspecified.
