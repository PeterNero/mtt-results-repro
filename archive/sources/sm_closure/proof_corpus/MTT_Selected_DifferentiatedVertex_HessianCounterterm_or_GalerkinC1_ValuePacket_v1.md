# MTT Selected DifferentiatedVertex HessianCounterterm or GalerkinC1 ValuePacket v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_DIFFERENTIATEDVERTEX_HESSIANCOUNTERTERM_OR_GALERKINC1_VALUEPACKET_BUILT_RESIDUAL_COMPLETION_OPEN`.

This artifact computes the exact residual-completion packet left after the
fixed-fiber primitive span is projected out of the conditional Weyl-pair
dynamic columns.

```text
phase residual ||R_Z||^2 per sector = 4.0
shift residual ||R_X||^2 per sector = 2.0
total routed residual norm^2        = 12.0
```

Both residuals are orthogonal to the fixed-fiber primitive span, and projection
plus residual reconstructs the conditional `I+Z` and `I+X` columns exactly.

This is still not selected SM closure.  The next theorem must prove that the
selected same-branch differentiated vertex, basis transport, or Hessian
counterterm emits these residuals, or an honest selected Galerkin C1 run must
emit replacement values.

No observed masses, mixings, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target residuals
are used as selectors.
