# MTT CONST EM 01 Alpha1 Dimensional Anchor Packet Gate v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EM_01_DIMENSIONAL_ANCHOR_PACKET_GATE_BUILT_VALUE_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-EM-01 / ALPHA1-PHYSICAL-ANCHOR / A6-DIMENSIONAL-ANCHOR-PACKET`

## Result

The next gate is now exact: alpha1 physical normalization can promote only if a
`SelectedDimensionalAnchorPacket` supplies a same-branch target-independent
physical unit and maps it to `alpha_phys`.

Selected route for the next attack:

`m_theory_modal_gap_planck_anchor`

This uses the superset strategy in a constrained way: the individual-constant
alpha1 row, QA/SU3 electroweak row, GR one-anchor metrology row, and M-theory
modal-gap row are combined only into one locked target: the selected dimensional
anchor packet. They are not independent knobs.

## Promotion Tests

The packet must supply:

- `dimensionful_quantity.value`,
- `source_certification.selected_by_mtt = true`,
- `source_certification.computed_before_target_comparison = true`,
- `map_to_alpha_phys.alpha_phys_value`,
- all no-backsolve forbidden-input checks.

## Boundary

The current M-theory packet fills the structural slot but not the physical
value. Therefore no value is claimed for `alpha_phys`, `K_phys`, `Omega0`,
`ell_p`, `kappa_11`, `alpha(0)`, or `alpha(M_Z)`.
