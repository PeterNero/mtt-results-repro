# RouteC C1 Defect Functional Source Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_C1_DEFECT_FUNCTIONAL_SOURCE_IMPORTED_PHIFINC1_BINDING_OPEN`.

The formal C1 defect functional is now sourced: it is the unique quadratic
trace/Frobenius leakage functional under the selected fixed-fiber span, static
sector routing, and no-extra-knob policy, up to an overall positive scale.  The
scale cancels from the Euler projection.

Current replay if physical application or independent data is supplied:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

Still not claimed: physical `Phi_fin^C1` minimization of this functional,
independent quadrature data, unpatched `A_selected`/`b_selected`/`deltaTheta_C1`,
unpatched SM dynamic closure, or true SM equivalence.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PhiFinC1MinimizesDefectFunctional_or_IndependentQuadratureTable_v1`.
