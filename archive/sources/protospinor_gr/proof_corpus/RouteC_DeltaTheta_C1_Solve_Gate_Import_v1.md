# Route-C DeltaTheta C1 Solve Gate Import v1

## Result

The diagnostic splitter is now encoded as an explicit finite real target vector.
The selected proof equation is:

```text
A_selected * deltaTheta_C1 = b_splitter
```

The target has real dimension `72` and norm square `24`, with four sector target
blocks of norm square `6`.

## Boundary

The selected response operator is not available. The rank, consistency, and
least-squares tests cannot be run until `A_selected` and `b_selected` are
emitted from selected Hessian, selected dotD, selected zero-mode bases, and
selected primitive C1 contractions.

The identity lift is diagnostic only and is rejected as proof data.
