# RouteC Dual Attempt Patched Spine Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_DUAL_ATTEMPT_PATCHED_SPINE_IMPORTED_UNPATCHED_OPEN`.

Both routes have now been tried under strict guardrails.

Route A applies a guarded local residual-projector axiom patch.  Inside that
patched local proof spine it promotes `A_selected`, `b_selected`, and
`deltaTheta_C1`, and closes the SM-parity dynamic C1 packet.

Route B replays the same strict 72-real target:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

This is not global SM closure and not an unpatched MTT derivation.  The honest
independent Galerkin lane remains open because the primitive contractions,
`b_selected`, and zero-mode basis are inherited/replayed rather than emitted by
an independent selected Galerkin computation.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_IndependentGalerkinC1Contractions_or_DeriveResidualProjectorAxiom_v1`.
