Status label: `PSM-C1-02 / SOURCE-IDENTITY / SI-1u-B`

Parallel route label: `PSM-C1-02 / SOURCE-IDENTITY / SI-1u-A`

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PSM_C1_02_SI1U_HONEST_GALERKIN_EXPORT_ATTEMPTED_REPLAY_HARNESS_ONLY`

Closed boundary label: `DONE-PARITY-00`

## Result

The existing Galerkin input packets are imported and audited. They provide a strict replay harness, but not an honest independent Galerkin export. The primitive and Hessian values still inherit the residual-projector/local-axiom contract, and the zero-mode basis is canonical Weyl support rather than an independently emitted HYM/zero-mode Galerkin basis.

So `SI-1u-B` made progress, but it does not close the unpatched source-promotion packet.

## Next

`SI-1u-B1`: emit an honest selected HYM/zero-mode basis source packet.

`SI-1u-B2`: compute independent primitive Galerkin/quadrature contractions for the 72 primitive rows.

They are not knobs; they are two required exits to the same unpatched source-identity target.
