# Selected Qa/SU3 Iwasawa Automorphy or Section Ring Construction v1

## Purpose

This artifact tries the next construction step after the line-bundle section-ring interface. It tests literal scalar constants, torus-style theta/Appell-Humbert transfer, and the Iwasawa automorphy/section-ring construction.

## Route Decision

```text
literal constant route: rejected, because all required section charges are nonzero
torus theta shortcut: rejected until an Iwasawa transfer theorem is supplied
selected source direct route: blocked, because section data are not printed
automorphy route: open, requires factor-of-automorphy cocycle
direct operator exit: open, if Dolbeault/Cech/rho_E packet is supplied
```

## Symbolic Rank-One Relation

If every required section space is one-dimensional, and if products are nonzero,

```text
eF_i * eG_i = m_i eP
```

then the monad condition reduces to:

```text
m1*u1*v1 + m2*u2*v2 + m3*u3*v3 + m4*u4*v4 + m5*u5*v5 = 0
```

All five products land in the expected target charge:

```text
P = K2 - K1 = (-1,1,0)
```

So we now have a symbolic construction pattern. This is not closure, because the section dimensions, bases, multiplication constants, and local-freeness test are still not selected.

## Required Automorphy Packet

The needed object is:

```text
a_q(gamma1 gamma2, z) = a_q(gamma1, gamma2.z) a_q(gamma2, z)
s_q(gamma.z) = a_q(gamma,z) s_q(z)
a_p a_q = a_(p+q)
```

for every required charge `q`, plus section bases and multiplication constants.
