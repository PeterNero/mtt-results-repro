# MTT SM-Equivalence Reference Source Registry v1

Status: `MTT_SM_EQUIVALENCE_REFERENCE_SOURCE_REGISTRY_BUILT_VALUES_OPEN`.

## Result

The measured replay now has approved external reference sources, but no numeric
values are copied in this artifact.

- PDG 2025: particle data, CKM, Higgs/electroweak, quark and charged-lepton references.
- NIST/CODATA 2022: fundamental constants, SI anchors, and unit conversions.
- NuFIT 6.0: neutrino oscillation parameters and PMNS conventions.

## Guardrail

This registry is still downstream of the selected source boundary.  It cannot
select topology, operators, branches, dynamic overlap tensors, or no-knob
kernels.  The next artifact, `MTT_SM_Equivalence_Reference_Data_Values_Fill_v1`, must freeze values and conversion
formulas before numeric replay.
