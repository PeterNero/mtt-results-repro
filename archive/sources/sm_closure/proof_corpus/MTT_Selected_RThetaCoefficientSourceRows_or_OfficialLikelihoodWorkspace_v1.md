# MTT Selected RTheta Coefficient Source Rows or Official Likelihood Workspace v1

## Claim

This artifact executes the strict `RThetaCoefficientSourceRow.v1` schema on all
ten `Rtheta` row slots.

It closes the execution attempt, not the rows.

## What Is Now Retired

The old projection-kernel objection is not the active blocker anymore:
`Pi_Rtheta` is closed by the later primitive-C1 import. The attempt also uses
the closed coefficient domain, dynamic source owner, same-branch convention,
strict row schema, and first-pass coefficient packet.

## Row Execution

Ten slots were attempted:

- `threshold::top`
- `threshold::bottom`
- `threshold::charm`
- `threshold::tau`
- `threshold::W_Z_H`
- `mass_scheme::top_direct_pole_running`
- `mass_scheme::bottom_MSbar_native_scale_transport`
- `mass_scheme::charm_MSbar_native_scale_transport`
- `mass_scheme::tau_pole_rest_to_running_lepton`
- `mass_scheme::Higgs_pole_running_lambda`

Uniformly satisfied strict clauses:

1. slot id in selected `Rtheta` coefficient codomain
2. `Pi_Rtheta` projector compatibility
3. same-branch scale/scheme/loop convention
4. no observed-value or target-residual selector
5. machine-checkable provenance path

Uniformly missing strict clauses:

1. selected row-specific source-owner certificate
2. selected coefficient-formula certificate
3. emitted selected coefficient value
4. selected threshold-response functional or equivalent value context

Therefore accepted strict rows remain `0/10`.

## Guardrail

The first-pass coefficient values are real replay support, but they are not
promoted to selected rows. They were derived from replay/Jacobian packets and
do not by themselves satisfy the row-specific source-owner, formula, value, and
threshold-response context clauses.

## Next Target

`MTT_Selected_RThetaRowOwnerFormulaValueEmitter_or_OfficialLikelihoodWorkspace_v1`

That artifact must emit the missing owner/formula/value/context clauses for at
least one strict row, or import an official machine-readable likelihood/profile
workspace.
