# Theta/Execution TeX Revision Manifest

Date: 2026-07-15

## Source Policy

The original ZIP files, `_work` TeX projects, `_md` conversions, and
`_md_v3_corrected` first-pass papers are immutable inputs to this revision.
All edits are made only in `revised_tex_vnext`.

For each paper, the revision order is:

1. read the original TeX section in context;
2. preserve every applicable correction from `_md_v3_corrected`;
3. remove the obsolete 4.2--5 TeV crossing/closure interpretation;
4. import only theorem rows accepted by the current authority ledger;
5. distinguish source theorem, conditional theorem, profile/replay,
   calibration, diagnostic, and held-out prediction;
6. compile and run claim/provenance checks before packaging a new ZIP.

## Current Numerical Authority

- The former 4.2--5 TeV gauge crossing is withdrawn.
- The selected replacement is SMDR v1.3 multi-loop matching/running at
  `Q=M_t=172.5590883453979 GeV`.
- The common-scheme gauge rows are
  `g_Y=0.3585945042245627`, `g_2=0.6475986707537685`, and
  `g_3=1.1634274089369543`.
- The full selected precision object has 8 rows, a positive-definite `8x8`
  covariance, 36/36 symmetric entries, and 15/15 BCT--WZH cross entries.
- The diagonal measured-input profile is the declared reproducible baseline;
  no official joint 15-coordinate likelihood is claimed.

## Current Closure Language

Permitted headline:

> MTT closes embedded renormalized-Standard-Model equivalence at the adopted
> one-shared-physical-primitive/profile standard on the selected branch.

Required adjacent limitation:

> This is an embedding/parity result with measured profile inputs and imported
> standard SM quantization. It is not zero-knob derivation, unique
> observed-branch selection, or a derivation of perturbative quantization from
> MTT.

## Foundational Geometry Reconciliation

The 2026-07-15 reconciliation is now controlling:

- `1+3 x 3=(1+3)+(1+2+3)=4+6` is a local component identity for
  `Q_WW in Hom(TP,TI)`, not multiplication of manifold dimensions.
- the shared circle is common `U(1)` phase/holonomy data and is counted once;
- the q79/Fu--Yau branch is the current global compactification candidate;
- `L(3,1) x Nil3` is an auxiliary/effective model;
- literal `S1 x Lens x Nil`, literal manifold nesting, and compact phase
  circle equals physical time are not proof premises.

Theta I--III were rechecked under this ontology. Their numerical profile
targets survive. Theta I's former simultaneous unit-`L2` normalization and
overlap definition was inconsistent because it forced every overlap to one.
The corrected papers use weighted gauge-kinetic coefficients with fixed
period/cohomology normalization and keep the Lens--Nil result at the calibrated
auxiliary-ansatz tier.

## Authority Files

The authority identifiers and absolute paths are maintained in
`../MTT_CORPUS_REVISION_UPDATE_LEDGER_2026-07-11.md`. In this batch the primary
sources are A01--A07, with A11--A13 used only for q79 and scoped GR-TT claims.

## Revision Progress

| Project | Current result |
|---|---|
| Theta Closure I v2 | Multi-loop profile targets retained; overlaps corrected to weighted gauge-kinetic coefficients; repeated-circle/product language removed; existence result classified as auxiliary calibration |
| Theta Closure II v2 | Route-A geometry retargeted to the new profile; shared circle counted once; Lens-base/Nil model explicitly separated from q79/Fu--Yau |
| Theta Closure III v2 | Route-B result retained as a conditional representation-level cross-check; literal seven-dimensional product rejected; weighted normalization and shared bridges explicit |
| Theta Closure IV v2 | `20.0706400 R1^3` retained only as the auxiliary `S1 x S2 x Nil3` volume coefficient; Newton relation requires the unproved `X_int=X_aux` identification |
| Theta Closure V v2 | Weak-angle relation reduced to its exact same-scale identity; selected Mt-scale value emitted; former 5 TeV prediction withdrawn; genuine held-out source criterion stated |
| Execution I v3 | q79 gauge/HYM/threshold status retained; selected q79 geometry explicitly separated from the auxiliary Lens--Nil overlap model; globalization intertwiner remains open |
| Execution II v3 | Rebuilt from current charged-flavor, CKM, Higgs and A30--A31 neutral authorities; fitted matrices retired; profile-standard closure separated from strict magnitude/neutrino source frontier |
| Superset Determinations v3 | Rebuilt as the parameter-identifiability ledger; obsolete crossing/zeta/K/minimum-threshold/alpha-s chain retired; claim classes and strict-upgrade accounting installed |
| Geometry-Light v3 | Exact identities separated from assumptions and phenomenological bounds; principal-symbol wave-speed condition and no-internal-gap-cutoff guard added |
| Tiered Roadmap v3 | Rebuilt as the audited non-looping master status with the 12/12 profile baseline, nine strict upgrades, named next objects, and reproducibility contract |
| Batch status | All ten versioned TeX projects contextually revised; compilation and final packaging remain |
