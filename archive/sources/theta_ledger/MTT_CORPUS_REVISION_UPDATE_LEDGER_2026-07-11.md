## Scope and source authority

This ledger resolves **137 papers**: 135 Markdown authoring files and 2 ZIP-only TeX sources. The external report covers 135 papers; the omitted book and dedicated MTT-to-SM paper are added here.

The Obsidian corpus is the default Markdown authoring source. The ten Theta/Execution papers are the exception: their next versions must start from the tracked `_md_v3_corrected` first-pass copies, because five contain material repairs not propagated to the vault. Other generated Markdown inside calculation repositories is evidence or conversion output, not a paper-edit target. The index and dedicated MTT-to-SM paper remain ZIP-only and must be revised through `main.tex` or converted before editing.

The first Theta pass covered **10/10** papers: **5** were materially corrected and **5** were copied unchanged. It corrected claim discipline, selected arithmetic, dimensional conventions and benchmark reproducibility, but retained the 5 TeV calibration and predates A01-A07.

## Authority order

- **A01** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Current_TrueSMClosure_ConsolidatedLedger_v1.md`: Current non-looping authority; locks the 27x27 matrix, Yukawa profile rows, Pi_CKM, PEW/direct-K, K-threshold and the accepted AH-equivalent lane.
- **A02** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_MultiLoopCommonSourcePrecisionTransport_or_OfficialJointLikelihood_v1.md`: Selected SMDR v1.3 multi-loop threshold/mass-scheme transport: 15 source coordinates to 8 MSbar rows, positive-definite 8x8 covariance, 36/36 entries and 15/15 BCT-WZH cross entries.
- **A03** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_RenormalizedSMObservableFunctor_FromCommonSchemeAction_v1.md`: Five-arrow perturbative observable functor on the embedded renormalized-SM branch; standard SM BRST/Faddeev-Popov quantization is imported, not derived from MTT.
- **A04** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_FinalGlobalTrueSMClosureAudit_AfterMultiLoopPrecision_v1.md`: Twelve of twelve obligations close embedded renormalized-SM equivalence at the adopted one-shared-physical-primitive/profile standard; no-knob and unique selection remain open.
- **A05** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_StrictNoKnobUpgradeLedger_AfterTrueSMEquivalence_v1.md`: Separates the closed 12/12 baseline from nine stronger upgrades: 2/9 closed, six partial, and one dependency-blocked. U2 literal Cech-HYM and U4 CKM prediction-profile are closed; this does not imply zero-knob global closure.
- **A06** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_OfficialJointLikelihoodTransport_or_DeclaredDiagonalProfileFinality_v1.md`: Declares the diagonal measured-input profile final for the current reproducible standard; no public 15-coordinate official joint likelihood was identified.
- **A07** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_LiteralCechWitness_or_GlobalHYMConnectionCoefficients_v1.md`: Closes the literal finite Cech witness (81 entries and 729 cocycle triples); literal global HYM connection coefficients remain open, so U2 is 1/2.
- **A08** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-q79-proof-repro\README.md`: Reproducible q=79/order-448, finite-gerbe, CP-character and conjugate-branch proof history; use only rows promoted by A01/A04 for final SM claims.
- **A09** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-repro\README.md`: Frozen historical SM-parity capsule. Its true-equivalence=false statement is superseded by A02-A04, while its no-knob guard remains valid.
- **A10** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\MTT_Master_Corrigendum_and_Revision_Plan.md`: External full-corpus audit and durable correction specification, subject to the explicit successor decisions in this ledger.
- **A11** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-q79-proof-repro\proof_corpus\Consolidated_Exact_Z64_to_q79_Closure_Theorem_v1.md`: Direct q=79 exact/charge theorem: q64=15, q7=2 and CRT give q=79 mod 448 on the selected exact branch, with its stated branch assumptions.
- **A12** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-q79-proof-repro\proof_corpus\Q79_Theorem_Change_List_for_Paper_Updates_v1.md`: Detailed q79 narrative correction ledger. Its older full-SM-open statements remain authoritative for strict no-proxy q79 closure but are superseded by A04 for the weaker adopted profile-standard equivalence claim.
- **A13** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-protospinor-gr-response-proof\proof_corpus\GR_TT_Support_Final_Theorem_v1.md`: Closes internal exact-branch TT support on the Z64 helicity-2 carrier; physical Newton/Planck normalization and full stress-energy response remain open.
- **A14** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_CKMCentralEstimatorRetirement_or_PredictionProfileClosure_v1.md`: Closes U4 at the selected prediction-with-uncertainty standard. The three source rows have maximum profile displacement 2.36e-4 sigma; exact equality to a moving experimental central estimator is retired as an invalid closure requirement.
- **A15** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GlobalHYMChernSequence_APosterioriCertificate_v1.md`: Types the global Chern sequence and certifies the finite projected HYM solution with residual 8.21e-13, coercivity margin 26.02, and error indicator 3.15e-14. Uniform continuum convergence and patchwise control remain open.
- **A16** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutrinoAndStrongCP_StrictUpgradeAttack_v1.md`: Selects the Dirac channel, restricts admissible Majorana self-characters to 0 and 672, and preserves the conditional PQ theorem and axion-ratio result. Absolute neutrino mass, unique neutrino ontology, and the selected central QCD-anomaly map remain open.
- **A17** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_BranchOrbitAndRetardedRepresentative_or_GlobalMeasureUniqueness_v1.md`: Closes the antiunitary orbit and selects the retarded q=79/F/m1 representative at orientation level. It does not prove uniqueness of the global MTT carrier measure.
- **A18** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_QuantizationAndNonperturbativeQFT_StrictUpgradeAudit_v1.md`: Records six conditional quantization results and four constructive finite-domain QFT results while preserving the missing capture-measure, BRST/gauge-orbit, continuum, and full four-dimensional existence obligations.
- **A19** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_HYMValidatedFourierResidualTailBound_v1.md`: Closes the selected rank-two continuum HYM witness by an exact weighted-theta Fourier-tail bound and Wiener contraction: Z=0.38508 and Y+Zr=0.00932703<r=0.01. Combined with A07/A15 patching, U2 literal witness families close 2/2; global uniqueness over all HYM branches and rank-three transfer are not claimed.
- **A20** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralNilBoundaryMassFunctional_v1.md`: Proves the neutral three-basin minimal-trace boundary theorem: if neutral nil-survivor saturation selects the trace-minimal positive spectrum, m_lightest=0 uniquely. NO/IO sums 0.058784/0.101001 eV are postchecks only. Source promotion, ordering selection, and Dirac-action completeness versus a separate Majorana operator remain open.
- **A21** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralOperatorUnificationAndInventoryAudit_v1.md`: Contracts the three neutral-mass source clauses to one selected complex-symmetric neutral operator. This predecessor checkpoint sources only the basis field (1/8) and rejects the dimensionless C1 nuD response as an absolute mass operator.
- **A23** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralMassOperator_SourceEmission_v1.md`: Successor to A21: imports the selected q79/F/m1 source id, literal HYM witness, selected Dirac route, Majorana self-character gate and no-observed-selector certificate. Neutral operator source-provenance inventory is now 4/8; dimensionful M_D/M_L/M_R blocks and absolute normalization remain open.
- **A24** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralDimensionfulBlocksAndNormalization_v1.md`: Successor to A23: proves the neutral dimensionful-block normal form and rejects benchmark seesaw matrices, observed neutrino splittings, conditional physical-unit bridges, and dimensionless C1 nuD as source selectors. The neutral inventory remains 4/8; the remaining exits are Dirac-complete M_D=v_u Y_nu, Majorana/seesaw blocks with k=0 or 672, or nil-boundary effective spectrum plus reconstruction.
- **A25** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralOverlapKernelPhysicalUnitOrActionCompleteness_v1.md`: Successor to A24: executes the neutral overlap-kernel/physical-unit/action-completeness gate. The selected overlap schema is support only, omega_gap_phys remains unselected, Dirac-only action completeness is not derived, neutral OK gates are 3/9, and accepted neutral exits remain 0/3 with no new U5 value rows.
- **A26** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralOverlapKernelValueSourceOrPhysicalUnitTheorem_v1.md`: Successor to A25: promotes selected neutral carrier/projector and trace-Gram readiness. L, N^c, and H-as-Hu carrier projectors plus same-source trace-Gram/slot consistency are selected; neutral overlap OK gates advance to 5/9 and readiness to 6/12. No neutral value rows are emitted and accepted exits remain 0/3.
- **A27** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralGammaNuActionRowsOrDiracCompleteness_v1.md`: Successor to A26: closes the selected typed L x N^c x H_u neutral trilinear carrier skeleton with nine structural Gamma_nu slots. Neutral overlap OK gates remain 5/9 and readiness advances to 7/13; finite Gamma_nu[i,j] channel sets, action costs, prefactors, retarded signs, Dirac-only completeness, and value rows remain open.
- **A28** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralFiniteGammaRowsOrActionCostSource_v1.md`: Successor to A27: imports the selected same-source dynamic overlap theorem and closes all nine finite neutral channel rows as `Gamma_nu^chan=I3+X3`, with six active channels and three exact zeros. Neutral OK gates advance to 6/9 and readiness to 8/13. These are exact channel multiplicities, not physical neutrino masses; action costs, prefactors, retarded signs, physical units, absolute normalization, and Dirac/Majorana completion remain open.
- **A29** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralActionCostPrefactorOrDiracMajoranaCompletion_v1.md`: Successor to A28: closes the selected two-representative neutral relative-amplitude orbit. Diagonal coefficients are `1` and active cyclic-shift coefficients are `3/2 +/- i sqrt(3)/2`, with magnitude `sqrt(3)`, phase `+/-pi/6`, and spectrum `[1,4,7]`. Eighteen relative dimensionless rows close across the conjugate pair; the absolute action scale/prefactor, unique representative, physical unit, and Dirac/Majorana completion remain open.
- **A30** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralAbsoluteAmplitudeNilAnchorOrDiracMajoranaCompletion_v1.md`: Successor to A29: promotes the complete same-source internal dimensionless `nuD` response. All 9/9 rows and 7/7 provenance fields close with `a_int=0.34195899479289005`; readiness advances to 9/14. This is not a physical Yukawa normalization or neutrino mass in eV, so physical value fields remain zero.
- **A31** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralPhysicalUnitOrNilAnchorProjector_v1.md`: Successor to A30: proves a common scale or physical unit cannot repair the selected `[1,4,7]` spectrum. Nil subtraction gives `[0,3,6]` and ratio `1/2`, incompatible with the downstream normal-ordering ratio `0.029805`. The scale-only route is retired; the minimal surviving route needs one selected non-affine spectral-action slope plus one universal scale, or a selected seesaw block.
- **A32** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralSpectralActionSlopeOrSeesawSource_v1.md`: Successor to A31: executes the available source-motivated neutral candidates. The exact internal proper-time trial gives `0.227768`; q79/q369 give `0.067879`; q7/qmod is closest at `0.031881` but misses the `0.029805` postcheck by `0.002076`. CP/retarded characters cannot be reused as Majorana self-characters. The remaining object is a typed neutral circle/proper-time-to-mass-cost transfer or neutral real-structure functor.
- **A33** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ProtoSpinorAlignmentToDiracMassReadout_v1.md`: Successor to A32: constructs a self-adjoint, chirally odd `6x6` operator from the selected rank-three `L/Nc` Weyl blocks and `I3+X3` transfer. `H1` is indefinite and therefore not the mass-squared Hessian. The coefficient-matched alignment trial has singular values `[0,a,2a]`, a nil zero mode and squared ratio `1/4`, but is not a selected VEV coordinate. The remaining source object is the radial second-variation/VEV theorem.
- **A34** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralRadialSecondVariationAndVEVCoordinateTheorem_v1.md`: Successor to A33: closes the exact formal Gram second variation with positive spectrum `[2,2,8]`, inventories the selected H radial values `tau_H` and `r_H`, and rejects their direct identity insertion into the neutral coordinate. At the adopted profile standard `v=246.219640 GeV` is the shared electroweak baseline and adds no neutrino-specific parameter, but is not a strict no-knob MTT derivation. The remaining object is the typed neutral Higgs-insertion functor and coordinate normalization.
- **A35** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralHiggsInsertionFunctorAndRadialCoordinateNormalization_v1.md`: Successor to A34: closes the same-source rank-one `H:h0` insertion. Unit normalization fixes the dimensionless insertion magnitude to one and gives `dY_nu/dh_H=Gamma_nu^chan=I3+X3` for all nine typed neutral cells. The unselected carrier `U(1)` phase cancels from the positive Gram curvature `[2,2,8]`. Physical `S_gamma/A_gamma` and retarded-character weights, strict dimensionful VEV selection and Majorana completion remain open; dimensionful M_D/M_L/M_R remain open. The strict frontier is the action-weighted neutral response and dimensionful Dirac readout.
- **A36** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralEffectiveWeightIdentifiabilityReduction_v1.md`: Successor to A35: proves separate `A_gamma` and `S_gamma` are non-identifiable factorization-gauge variables in `W_gamma=A_gamma exp(-S_gamma) sign_gamma` and retires their independent row obligations. The combined same-source internal effective response is already selected, and conjugate representatives have identical mass-Gram spectra. The physical Dirac cutset is one selected non-affine shape coordinate plus one absolute scale.
- **A37** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralCRTPhaseTypingAndProtoSpinorNilDriftReduction_v1.md`: Successor to A36: proves `q7=2` is a `Z7` residue with local phase fraction `2/7` and q7-only CRT lift `128/448=2/7`, not `2/448`. The former `0.031881` clue is retired as mistyped. The proto-spinor three-basin nil-drift formula remains the correctly typed neutral shape family; genuine `phi_nu` and one absolute scale `mu_nu` remain open.
- **A38** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralCommonCircleFactorizationAndHolonomyScalarReduction_v1.md`: Successor to A37: derives the proto-spinor cosine orbit from selected `H_cen=diag(1,zeta3,zeta3^2)` through `H_nu(phi_nu)=exp(i phi_nu)H_cen`. It proves `phi_nu=(arg det H_nu)/3 mod 2pi/3`, reducing shape to one scalar. The operator-level neutral response, its phase value and anchored Hessian scale remain open.
- **A39** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralFiniteHeisenbergDeterminantNoGoAndSmoothLiftTarget_v1.md`: Successor to A38: checks all 27 finite Heisenberg elements and proves the promoted qutrit `rho_E` image lies in `SU(3)` with trivial determinant. It cannot source continuous `phi_nu`; determinant-trivial phases only permute the `Z3` orbit and retain exact degeneracy. The required source is a smooth determinant-line `U(1)` holonomy plus anchored scale.
- **A40** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralTwoPrimitiveProfileValueClosure_v1.md`: Successor to A39: at the explicitly declared normal-ordering Dirac profile with m_lightest=0, two measured mass-squared splittings uniquely calibrate phi_nu and A_nu and emit 36 neutral mass, Yukawa and matrix rows. This is measured-profile completion, not strict no-knob source selection.
- **A41** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralLensDedekindTransgression_or_OnePrimitiveProfile_v1.md`: Successor to A40: the selected retarded pair 16->15 gives the exact Lens/Dedekind mixed reciprocity residue 1/240. Conditional identification with the neutral determinant line gives phi_nu=pi/120 and reduces the splitting profile to one measured scale, with a 0.0233-sigma compatibility pull. The APS/Bismut-Freed operator and cancellation normalization remain open, and the hypothesis is target-ranked rather than pre-registered.
- **A42** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralUniversalE0AttenuationCandidate_or_SourceLawFrontier_v1.md`: Successor to A41: combines the existing one-anchor GR E0 family, selected N=448 and tau_int=log(448)/15, the conditional corpus 11D M-theory lift, and the A41 phase in the target-ranked trial mu_nu=E0*448^-11*exp(-tau_int/4). With measured G as the one universal metrology primitive, the resulting neutral Hessian amplitude agrees with A40 at about 18 ppm. Native MTT is 10D, so the physical neutral-operator lift identification, attenuation law, normalization and APS identification remain open.
- **A43** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralCompositeSpectralAttenuationReduction_or_BranchBridgeTheorem_v1.md`: Successor to A42: conditionally proves the exact 11D-lift compression 448^-11 exp(-tau_int/4)=exp(-tau_int*661/4) and proves 1/(1+r_nu) is the unit-trace normalization of the A41 shape. Native MTT has census 4+(1+2+3)=10; only the separate circle lift gives 11, and the native 10D formula misses A40 by 448^2 in A_nu. Strict promotion requires physical neutral-operator lift selection, nil saturation and a same-operator Z64/nil bridge.
- **A44** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SameGeometryQutritToSMAlgebraBridge_or_GenerativeBaseFrontier_v1.md`: Locks the already-closed embedded renormalized-SM observable functor and attacks the stronger generative base. It proves A_Q=M3(C)^3 is not directly the SM finite algebra, then constructs an exact conditional three-lane reduction C plus H plus M3(C) using rank-one/rank-two/full corners and a quaternionic antiunitary real structure. Native selection of the lane projectors and weak real structure, followed by the chiral representation and anomaly table, remains open.
- **A45** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ClassLaneProjectorsAndWeakRealStructureSourceTheorem_v1.md`: Proves the native circle/lens/nil rank flag `1<2<3` and proto-spinor symplectic `J=epsilon K` are unique up to unitary/phase equivalence and hence are not empirical matrix knobs. The rank-one/rank-two/full projectors and quaternionic weak real structure are therefore the same-geometry source frontier. It also corrects A44's physical interpretation: `C3_class` is the Z3 family/character factor, not the gauge-rank flag, so the lane-wise C/H/M3 reduction is abstractly valid but cannot be the physical family-universal SM representation. The corrected target preserves `C3_family` and constructs `A_F` on a separate one-family factor acting diagonally. Dirac/Weyl/twistor common-carrier identity is closed; strict same-value readiness is 4/9.
- **A46** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_TypedFamilyGaugeCarrierAndDiagonalSMRepresentationTheorem_v1.md`: Consolidates already-selected cross-repo ingredients into the missing typed representation packet `H_chiral=C3_family tensor H_16`, dimension 48, with gauge action `I3_family tensor rho_16`. It emits Q, u^c, d^c, L, e^c and N^c rows and machine-checks exact cancellation of SU3-cubic, mixed SU3/U1 and SU2/U1, U1-cubic, gravitational/U1 and global SU2 Witten anomalies on that same packet. The selected SU3 bundle in visible E8 genuinely sources E6 and three chiral 27s, and the displayed subgroup decomposition is exact representation theory. Open is the narrower physical vacuum-breaking selector proving that this compactification realizes that low-energy subgroup route, plus native unimodularity and the full Connes bimodule.
- **A47** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NativeBundleAutomorphismGaugeGroup_or_ParameterAssumptionAudit_v1.md`: Closes the low-energy gauge group directly from the selected native bundle tensors: rank-one circle gives U1, rank-two lens preserving epsilon/J gives USp2=SU2, and determinant-trivial rank-three nil/visible carrier gives SU3. Exact center action on the A46 rows has diagonal kernel Z6, so the faithful global group is `(SU3 x SU2 x U1)/Z6`. The direct route removes the E6 Wilson-line obligation at low energy while retaining E6 as a compatible UV encoding. It also audits A40-A46 assumptions: A44-A47 add zero continuous knobs; profile/metrology inputs, exact discrete candidates, rejected hypotheses, gauge representatives and proof obligations are counted separately.
- **A48** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NativeGaugeActionToFiniteBimodule_or_DirectGenerativeSMBaseClosure_v1.md`: Extends A46/A47 to an explicit `96`-dimensional three-family particle-antiparticle `A_F=C+H+M3(C)` bimodule. The matrix execution closes multiplicativity, star preservation, KO-dimension-6 real/grading signs, order zero, and structural order one for the selected up/down/charged-lepton/Dirac-neutrino channel incidence. Unit incidence coefficients are structural witnesses, not physical Yukawa parameters. Physical selected `D_F` entries, orientability and Poincare duality remain before claiming the full finite Connes triple.
- **A49** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_PhysicalFiniteDiracOperatorAndIntersectionForm_or_FullFiniteTripleClosure_v1.md`: Inserts the accepted charged and two-primitive neutral profile matrices into an explicit `96x96 D_F` and closes self-adjointness, oddness, KO6 reality, order zero and order one at the declared profile tier. It then proves that the native `C+H+M3(C)` KO6 triple cannot satisfy the remaining axioms: the `N_R:C--C` self-edge obstructs orientability and the antisymmetric `3x3` intersection form has determinant zero. The minimal completion `C+H+M3(C)+C_N`, changing only `N_R:C_N--C`, has an explicit 17-term Hochschild zero-cycle and intersection determinant `4` per family (`324` for three families). This adds no continuous knob, but selection of `C_N` from the selected `1_M=N^c` carrier and reduction or breaking of its extra neutral unitary direction remain open.
- **A50** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralAlgebraSummandOrEquivalentAxiomRevision_v1.md`: Consumes A49's discrete completion obligation. The selected complex line `1_M=N^c` canonically supplies `C_N=End_C(1_M)`, while A49 forces its primitive central idempotent to remain distinct. The abelian anomaly constraints have rank two and unique primitive null vector `(alpha_C,mu_M3,nu_CN)=(3,-1,3)`, reproducing exactly `6Y=(1,-4,2,-3,6,0)`. A separate `C_N` phase has nonzero gravitational and cubic anomalies. Thus the finite-algebra sheets share one selected anomaly-free physical circle, preserve `(SU3 x SU2 x U1_Y)/Z6`, and close the completed finite triple at profile tier with zero new continuous knobs. This is a low-energy theorem on the selected A46 spectrum, not a prohibition of optional ultraviolet Green--Schwarz or extra-Higgs extensions.
- **A51** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_FiniteSpectralActionAndHiggsInnerFluctuation_or_DirectGenerativeSMActionClosure_v1.md`: Executes all 676 finite-algebra one-form basis pairs. The unrestricted A50 real fluctuation space has rank 12 and consists of three rank-four scalar doublet modules, so the raw completed triple is not automatically the one-Higgs SM. The earlier q79/ProtoSpinor alignment rule is now executed as an exact rank-four submodule with residual `6.15e-15`; its idempotent projector removes eight unwanted real scalar directions. Three-family gauge traces are `10:6:6`, becoming `6:6:6` after standard `5/3` hypercharge normalization, and the profile `D_F` emits finite Yukawa invariants `a=3.156678733984891`, `b=3.316964061249446`. The standard heat-kernel theorem supplies the bosonic operator content, but selected four-dimensional base geometry, cutoff moments, absolute normalization and spectral-scale RG transport remain open.
- **A52** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SpectralCutoffMomentsAndSpacetimeProductTriple_or_BosonicActionNormalization_v1.md`: Closes the four-dimensional product-triple interface and bosonic matter normalization at the adopted profile standard. It also proves a universal-normalization no-go: accepted SM running never satisfies `g1_GUT=g2=g3`; the best one-loop point near `1.72e14 GeV` still has `max/min=1.046656`, confirmed by the archived multi-loop grid. The exact profile exit is `K_gauge=diag(1.956842576,1,0.309837026)` with residual `4.58e-16`, using two measured relative coupling coordinates but adding zero parameters beyond the SM profile. Only `f0 K_i`, `f2 Lambda^2`, and `f4 Lambda^4` are identifiable. The invalid old 5 TeV chain is not reused; strict closure still needs a selected proper-time measure, source-derived overlap metric, Wick map and gravity/vacuum normalization.
- **A53** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ProperTimeMeasureAndOverlapKineticMetricSource_or_StrictSpectralActionClosure_v1.md`: Separates the remaining spectral sources. Exact `tau_int=log(448)/15` gives a positive rank-one moment sequence under an explicit zero-new-scale/minimal-support premise, but that premise remains conditional. It proves any scalar proper-time measure leaves gauge-sector ratios invariant and therefore cannot source `K_gauge`. The natural rank metric `diag(2,1,1/3)` is tested over the full running interval and rejected as a non-exact near-hit. Strict numerical closure is reduced to two overlap ratios from the selected literal HYM/bundle connections at one declared scale, with zero new parameters.
- **A54** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeOverlapMetricFromLiteralHYMConnections_or_StrictSpectralActionClosure_v1.md`: Executes the literal-HYM provenance and identifiability audit. The converged diagonal `exp(S)` rank-2 solve supplies one genuine `SU(2)`/lens connection representative with residual below `10^-12`, but it does not yet evaluate a common-scheme four-dimensional gauge kinetic functional. The common circle remains degree-zero/spectator and the rank-2-to-rank-3 result does not emit finite `SU(3)` values. Thus the strict record has `1/3` connection representatives, `0/3` kinetic rows and `0/2` computable same-source ratios. One scalar response has rank at most one in the two-ratio plane, and all canonical finite-trace/rank/dimension completions are rejected. A machine-readable completion contract isolates the missing circle/nil connections and all three common-scheme kinetic/threshold rows, with zero new continuous parameters.
- **A55** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_CommonSchemeGaugeKineticPayloadSearch_or_FiniteProjectedThresholdCandidate_v1.md`: Searches all current repositories against the A54 contract. It recovers the exact accepted tree-level common-scheme payload `(6,6,6)` from the completed finite triple. It constructs the strongest finite projected threshold candidate from the selected `F3xF3` base determinant `L=14.6008251661` and post-shared-circle multiplicities `(2,2,3)`, yielding `(29.2016503322,29.2016503322,43.8024754983)`; its U1 row exactly agrees with the independent `P_perp` quotient determinant. The full factorized source is not selected, and both signs of the canonical determinant response and SM-beta weighting fail exact common-scale matching. Existing U1, scoped SU2 and SU3 components are not rows of one effective action. The remaining exact object is a gauge-generator-inserted graded heat supertrace/second variation with a common domain, regulator, scale and scheme; zero new continuous parameters were introduced.
- **A56** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeInsertedHeatSupertraceSecondVariation_or_CommonSchemeThresholdPayload_v1.md`: Executes every grading already selected on the explicit 96-dimensional finite fermion carrier. The ordinary gauge insertion is universal, the KO6 chiral supertrace vanishes exactly because charge-conjugate states have opposite chirality and equal squared charges, and uniform fermion parity only reverses the universal sign. Tensoring any of these with the selected base determinant has relative gauge rank zero. Hence KO chirality cannot substitute for statistics grading, and regrading the finite fermion carrier cannot produce the threshold vector. A machine-readable source contract now isolates the full gauge-fixed second-variation complex: gauge one-form, ghost, fermion and Higgs Hessians from one action, with one BRST/zero-mode/regulator/scale/scheme policy and zero new continuous parameters.
- **A57** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeFixedFluctuationComplexHessians_or_OneLoopThresholdSupertracePayload_v1.md`: Constructs the full gauge-fixed fluctuation complex at structural and heat-index level. Summing the selected `Q,u,d,L,e,N` left-Weyl representation indices, the one-Higgs scalar index, and gauge/FP-ghost adjoint terms derives exactly `b=(41/10,-19/6,-7)` without using the accepted QFT vector as a selector. Tensoring all blocks with the same selected finite determinant gives `b_a L/(8pi^2)`, proved algebraically equivalent to a one-loop matching-scale translation and therefore unable to repair the universal-boundary no-go. The remaining numerical payload is ten sector/representation-resolved internal spectra computed from selected connections under one BRST/regulator/scale/scheme policy; zero new continuous parameters were introduced.
- **A58** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SectorResolvedInternalFluctuationSpectra_or_NonUniversalGaugeThresholdPayload_v1.md`: Populates the A57 spectrum contract from current selected packets. Exact `Q,u,d,L,e,N,H` finite spectra are imported from the theorem-derived 27-mode heat packet, and the `U1` gauge/ghost self-interaction row is exactly zero because `C2(U1)=0`, closing `8/10` rows. The selected diagonal-HYM `SU2` adjoint is proved scalar-isospectral and yields an explicit finite `F3xF3` candidate once its unit-torus-to-finite scale intertwiner is selected. The finite Heisenberg `SU3` adjoint commutator Laplacian is computed exactly with raw spectrum `3` (multiplicity 4) and `6` (multiplicity 4), but its identification and normalization as the gauge/ghost Hessian remain open. Zero new continuous parameters were introduced.
- **A59** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SU2FiniteScaleBinding_and_SU3AdjointGaugeHessianSource_v1.md`: Executes both remaining finite binding attempts. For `SU2`, the direct HYM theorem acts on four real torus coordinates while `F3xF3` retains two finite character labels, so a `1/9` eigenvalue rescaling is insufficient without a selected holomorphic/twisted projection and gauge-transported finite-basis intertwiner. For `SU3`, the correct base-plus-adjoint Kronecker-sum candidate has 72 positive modes with multiplicities `4,20,32,16`; it fails the common-scale gauge test. The adjacent Qa/SU3 authority independently classifies clock/shift data as a visible projective auxiliary branch, not the color threshold operator, so the simple finite-adjoint route is retired. The primary source is fixed as the full real Strominger/Weitzenböck color-bundle Hessian after BRST quotient; readiness remains `8/10` with zero new parameters.
- **A60** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SU2HolomorphicProjection_and_SU3P0BRSTNormalizationLock_v1.md`: Closes the old `SU3 p=0` BRST measure ambiguity. For every nonzero horizontal scalar eigenmode, Hodge decomposition gives one exact and one coexact one-form mode; the background-Feynman-gauge weights `1/2+1/2-1` cancel exactly, while harmonic modes are removed by the primed determinant. Thus the selected `p=0` gauge/ghost finite part is zero without using the old Qa target, retiring the leave/cancel/half-density menu. In the fixed convention the sourced `p!=0` block reduces to `-1.29503606378`, but is not promoted without same-source color-operator binding. A hash-based frontier lock leaves exactly two obligations: the `SU2` holomorphic finite-projection intertwiner and `SU3 p!=0` full real Strominger operator; zero new parameters were introduced.
- **A61** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SU2TransportClosedFiniteGaugeRow_and_SU3NativeColorSourceReduction_v1.md`: Applies the previously proved transport-closed symbolic quotient to the selected `F3xF3` base and closes the `SU2` gauge/ghost row exactly: `0` (x3), `4pi^2/9` (x12), `8pi^2/9` (x12), with no inserted scale and no raw-Fourier closure claim. Spectrum readiness advances to `9/10`. For the rejected heterotic matrix lane, the unique signed one-entry Heisenberg repair is `B2=-sqrt(mu)E32`; its full positive `mu` family is one `SL3(C)` gauge orbit and its two-dimensional commutant is incompatible with the claimed stable simple rank-three bundle, so neither `mu` nor the repaired matrix is a physical color source. The native color row instead reduces to the adjoint Nil Hodge/BRST complex. The old `c_nil=1.439 R1` numerical diagnostic is explicitly barred because it belongs to the withdrawn 5 TeV profile; the revised `0.9948493 R1` value is also calibrated rather than strictly selected. One row remains, requiring a same-source native Nil metric and one full gauge-fixed factorization/finite-part theorem; zero new parameters were introduced.
- **A62** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SU3AdjointCentralTrivialFiniteGaugeRow_and_TenSpectrumClosure_v1.md`: Closes the final native `SU3` gauge/ghost spectrum row without importing a continuum Nil radius. The selected rank-three carrier has full automorphism `SU3`; its fundamental commutant is scalar and its trace-free commutant is zero, while the selected projective-flat `Z3` center acts trivially in the adjoint. Thus the exact finite color operator is `Delta_F3xF3 tensor I8`, with `0` (x8), `4pi^2/9` (x32), and `8pi^2/9` (x32). Spectrum-source readiness is now `10/10`, exact and zero-parameter. This also closes the honest limitation theorem: after normalization per rank/adjoint lane, every nontrivially weighted row carries the same determinant `L=14.6008251661`, so the threshold is exactly `b_a L/(8pi^2)`, a matching-scale translation. The spectrum contract is closed, but strict no-knob gauge-coupling prediction is not; any further route requires genuinely new source-selected noncentral endomorphism/connection data and must not reopen these rows.
- **A63** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NonUniversalGaugeEndomorphismSource_or_CommonSpectrumNoGoFinality_v1.md`: Converts the post-A62 noncentral-source request into an exact finite response theorem. Schur reduction on the A46 carrier gives sector blocks `E_s tensor I_Rs`; the representation-index/heat matrix has rank two after projection to `(U1-SU2,SU3-SU2)`. A family operator repeated over complete identical SM families has relative rank zero, so family splitting cannot repair the common-spectrum no-go. Charged `u,d,e` support has rank one and the one-Higgs support supplies an independent rank-one direction; together they form the minimal algebraically sufficient support pattern. This does not promote their scalar values into a gauge Hessian: current same-source gauge-Hessian value payloads remain `0`, with zero new continuous parameters.
- **A64** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SameSourceGaugeHessianCrossUse_or_SectorEndomorphismValueEmission_v1.md`: Tests and rejects direct reuse of charged/Higgs overlap `K` rows as tree-level gauge kinetic coefficients. In the selected A51 asymptotic spectral action the gauge rows are `f0 Tr_HF(T_a^2)=(6,6,6)f0`, while `D_F`/Yukawa data enter separate Higgs/Yukawa invariants. Mass-dependent vacuum-polarization thresholds are a legitimate transport calculation only after physical masses, matching scale, regulator and scheme are typed; they do not select the absolute gauge boundary condition. The non-looping strict target is now three native common-scheme quadratic rows for `U1_circle`, `SU2_lens` and `SU3_nil`, or the equivalent three insertions of one selected gauge heat supertrace. Current native functional readiness is `0/3`; no A62 row is reopened and no charged/Higgs result is demoted.
- **A65** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeZeroModeKineticInnerProduct_or_ChernWeilBackgroundEnergyNoGo_v1.md`: Corrects the remaining observable target. A four-dimensional gauge kinetic coefficient is the Hessian/Gram matrix of four-dimensional gauge zero modes, represented on the A46 carrier by `K_ab=Tr_HF(W_kin T_a T_b)` with positive gauge-commutant weight `W_kin`. The exact six-sector tree trace map has relative rank two and `W_kin=I` reproduces `(6,6,6)`. The Higgs is not an independent tree finite-carrier trace column; its A63 direction belongs only to the loop/threshold map. Direct promotion of the HYM residual, bare Chern class, or old circle/sphere scalar zeta proxy is rejected because these are different functionals without a same-action reduction theorem. The surviving source object is one positive `W_kin`; current fill is `0/1`, yielding nonuniversal gauge rows `0/3`.
- **A66** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_FiniteKineticWeightOperatorSource_or_CircleLensNilZeroModeGramExecution_v1.md`: Audits every current all-sector `W_kin` candidate. A62 common heat weights, scalar proper time, selected `rho_UV`, transported stationary `rho_s` unit Gram blocks and unitary common-circle holonomy are universal or scalar and therefore have relative rank zero. Fifteen predeclared positive Casimir heat trials using existing selected internal times and integer circle/lens/nil coefficient permutations were executed; none is exact and none is promoted. The superset route is reduced to one positive block-diagonal `Phi_sector^+`: it can feed both `W_kin=N_kin(Phi_sector^+)` for gauge normalization and the common-circle flavor trace `Tr(P_s B_k H_cen Phi_sector^+)`. Projectors, `rho_s`, unit Gram, `H_cen`, family dual rows and the rank-two trace map are already selected; numerical positive sector blocks and same-action kinetic normalization remain open, with zero new parameters.
- **A67** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_PositiveSectorDensitySourceTheorem_or_CommonGaugeFlavorWeightEmission_v1.md`: Constructs the exact positive C1 density at the explicitly axiom-conditional parity tier. The right blocks have spectrum `[4,1,1]` and trace `6`; incidence pullback gives equal `Q,L` blocks with trace `12`. It then proves a class-level no-go: every positive density with `w_Q=w_L=a` and `w_u=w_d=w_e=w_N=b` has `K3/K2=1/2+b/(2a)>1/2`, incompatible with the accepted profile. More generally, crossing below one half requires `l>q+2(u+d)`. Thus a strict source must distinguish quark and lepton doublets or suppress colored sectors; generation splitting alone cannot work. No strict gauge values are promoted.
- **A68** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_QuarkLeptonDoubletResolvedPositiveDensitySource_or_KineticWeightEmission_v1.md`: Solves the minimal Q/L-resolved positive-density problem. For traces `(12s,6s,6s,12,6t,6)`, a one-factor colored attenuation obeys the exact incompatible relation `K1/K2=6/5-(4/5)(K3/K2)`. The two-factor inverse is unique and positive, with inferred costs `-log(s)/tau_int=4.6672185544` and `log(t)/tau_int=3.0258312712`. The nearest simple existing-`tau_int` costs `14/3` and `3` give only `0.0155%` color and `0.764%` abelian relative residuals. A corpus-native composite clue factors `14/3=7*(1/2)*(4/3)` from the candidate nil sevenfold, proved color-completion Schur half and color Casimir; cost `3` is suggested by three charged-lepton basins times an unproved unit circle cost. This remains a diagnostic source factorization, not strict numerical closure; accepted strict gauge values remain zero.
- **A69** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_CommonQuarkOrder_SharedCircleKineticOperator_or_ExactResidualSpectrum_v1.md`: Constructs the explicit finite projected operator `W_kin=exp(-tau_int C_sector)Phi_C1^+` with costs `(14/3,14/3,14/3,0,-3,0)`. It is bounded, self-adjoint, strictly positive and gauge commuting. The colored cost is conditionally factored through the sevenfold carrier, color-completion Schur half and `C2(3)`; the lepton cost is the direct sum of three primitive normalized-circle modes, while the Z7-to-color bridge and inverse-heat sign remain source assumptions. A determinant test proves that a common normalization plus one-loop matching-scale transport cannot remove the residual. The unique remaining two-support correction is `delta_q=0.0005518878`, `delta_e=0.0258312712`, still profile-inferred and unpromoted.
- **A70** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ResidualCircleLensCostOperator_or_ExactGaugeKineticValueEmission_v1.md`: Computes the exact positive q79 common-circle chord `4 sin^2(79pi/448)` and Lens-quarter logarithmic cost `T79=0.0254239317`. An explicit zero-continuous-parameter retarded-resolvent candidate uses `D=2*15+16+1/15` and routing `R=(15+16)/(6*7)=31/42`, giving costs `c_col=14/3+T79/D` and `c_e=3+T79+R T79/D`. The resulting gauge ratios differ from the accepted profile by only `0.00393` and `-0.00185` ppm, improving A69 by a factor `1.77e6`. This is not promoted: the formula was assembled after the residual was known, and same-action multiplicity/routing plus independent scale/covariance validation remain mandatory. Accepted strict gauge values remain zero.
- **A71** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ActualZ64TowerKineticFunctionalTyping_or_ResolventRoutingPromotion_v1.md`: Audits A70 against the actual selected tower operator rather than its labels. Enumerating all sixteen ordered compositions of `32=2^5` gives the exact spectrum `15(x1),24(x4),33(x3),69(x3),78(x2),258(x2),1023(x1)`, with ground/next/gap `(15,24,9)` and exact ground heat weight `exp(-15 tau_int)=1/448`. Therefore A70's denominator is not currently a selected Hessian trace: `16` is a retarded carrier label, the second `15` is a multiplicity hypothesis, `1/15` is a proper-time/resolvent scalar, and exact-branch Schur leakage is zero. The numerical conjecture remains frozen but strict promotion is rejected. Abstractly, any isometric embedding of `diag(15,16)` into the 42-dimensional six-carry-by-seven-charge carrier has normalized trace `31/42`; physical selection of that block, embedding and action trace remains open. Eight typed functions of the actual spectrum produce zero exact residual matches.
- **A72** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeKineticFunctionalOfL64AndQ79Chord_or_StrictResidualValueEmission_v1.md`: Replaces A70's mixed-type arithmetic by a typed spectral functional. With `G64=(1/16)Tr(L64^-1)`, exact q79 Lens-quarter chord cost `T79`, the nontrivial `Z7` projector rank `6/7` and nontrivial Lens-`Z4` rank `3/4`, it defines `delta_q=T79(6/7)G64` and `delta_e=T79+(3/4)delta_q`. All factors are normalized dimensionless traces or positive spectral values. The complete 36-row canonical projector grid over `Z3,Z4,Z7,Z16,Z64,unit` makes `Z7 x Lens-Z4` the unique best row by a factor `9.78`; the frozen zero-continuous-parameter gauge ratios are within `0.576` and `1.191` ppm of the same profile. Because the grid was ranked after that profile was known, this is not independent prediction or strict value promotion.
- **A73** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeKineticActionDerivationAndFrozenProfileValidation_v1.md`: Proves A72 is emitted exactly by one finite positive gauge-commuting normalized determinant action. The identity `d log det A=Tr(A^-1 dA)` on `H_q=L64 tensor I7+epsilon T79 I tensor P7_nontrivial` yields `delta_q`; a direct chord term plus the Lens-projected return block yields `delta_e`. Thus mathematical same-action existence closes and the A72 packet is SHA-256 frozen before further tests. Physical MTT selection remains open: the actual Hessian must contain these blocks, `N_kin` must be the normalized determinant response, routing must be selected, and counterterms must preserve relative rows. Buttazzo et al. is recorded as a possible external NNLO MSbar reference, but no numerical validation is admitted without commensurate scale/input/covariance transport.
- **A74** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NormalizedDeterminantActionFromMTTHessian_or_IndependentGaugeProfileTest_v1.md`: Closes two post-A73 obligations without promoting the gauge values. First, positivity, normalization and unitary-conjugation invariance force the unique finite functional `Tr/n`; tensor compatibility then fixes `Tr/16`, `Tr/7`, `Tr/4`, while the nontrivial `Z7` and Lens-`Z4` projector traces are exactly `6/7` and `3/4`. These coefficients are therefore finite-algebra consequences, not adjustable normalizations. Second, the already frozen A72 ratios are transported from `172.5590883 GeV` to the independent legacy Buttazzo `Mt=173.34 GeV` profile with one-loop SM beta coefficients; one common normalization is fixed by `SU2`, and the shared-input covariance gives `chi2=3.70499` for two degrees of freedom (`p=0.15685`). This passes a compatibility test but is neither a modern precision confirmation nor a strict prediction, because the A72 row was originally target-ranked and higher-loop transport uncertainty is omitted. The remaining physical gate is sharply reduced to deriving the displayed determinant blocks and response from the selected MTT Hessian/action, with routing, coemission and counterterm control, followed by modern covariance-aware validation. Zero new continuous parameters and zero accepted strict gauge values.
- **A75** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_PhysicalKineticHessianBlockIdentity_or_ModernPrecisionGaugeValidation_v1.md`: Proves the finite complex-Gaussian theorem selecting the `log det` response shape once a physical positive complex Hessian and statistics are supplied. It also corrects the direct-sum scope of A74: `Tr/n` is uniquely forced within each simple matrix block, while the canonical direct-sum object is the center-valued trace and scalar weights between blocks are not fixed by conjugation symmetry alone. An exact domain theorem rejects relabelling the closed 27-mode `Phi_fin^C1` action as the A73 `112`- or `64`-dimensional Hessian. A counterterm theorem shows that the three gauge-invariant quadratic terms leave a rank-two relative finite-matching space after quotienting one common normalization. Thus the determinant shape is closed, but strict promotion requires one selected gauge-insertion intertwiner and microscopic finite matching condition. Zero new continuous parameters and zero accepted strict gauge values.
- **A76** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeInsertionIntertwinerAndFiniteMatchingCondition_v1.md`: Constructs the canonical tower-augmentation domains and tests the strongest existing-carrier shortcut. The active A73 dimensions are `16*6=96` for `C16_L64 tensor Aug(Z7)` and `16*3=48` for `C16 tensor Aug(Z4)`, exactly matching the selected full finite fermion and three-family chiral dimensions. The equality is a real clue but not an intertwiner: `C16_L64` and `H16_SM` have different source types, every homomorphism `Z7 -> Z3 x Z2` is trivial, and every homomorphism `Z4 -> Z3` is trivial, so the nontrivial augmentation actions cannot be identified with family/conjugation bookkeeping. Identity intertwiners on the mathematical product domains replay A73, but no physical gauge/ghost/Higgs/fermion BRST complex or first-derivative finite matching condition emits them. The next object is the selected gauge-fixed fluctuation complex on the tower-augmentation domains; zero new continuous parameters and zero accepted strict gauge values.
- **A77** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeFixedFluctuationComplexOnTowerAugmentationDomains_v1.md`: Constructs the exact four-dimensional background-Feynman-gauge subcomplex on a supplied internal Hessian. Four real gauge components with determinant weight `+1/2` and one complex FP ghost with weight `-1` give `(4/2)-1=1`, exactly selecting the A73 `log det` multiplicity; the q one-form domain has dimension `4*16*7=448`. The selected exact q79 branch also closes the character-support routing: primitive `q7=2` generates all `Z7` characters and forces rank-six `P7` after deleting the invariant mode, while the lepton `16 mod 64` quarter-turn generates `Z4` and forces rank-three `P4`; its selected rank-one Lens character gives `(1/4)log Delta79=T79`. The resulting q and e BRST/character derivatives reproduce A73 below `1e-15`. Physical product-triple placement, spectator cancellation and finite matching remain open; zero new continuous parameters and zero accepted strict gauge values.
- **A78** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ProductTripleGaugeFluctuationFunctorAndRelativeBoundaryCondition_v1.md`: Attaches A77's center-valued response to the already selected `P_colored`/`P_e` six-sector kinetic trace through `W_kin=exp[-tau(C0+delta_q P_colored+s_e delta_e P_e)]Phi_C1^+`. This formal center-to-sector functor is bounded, positive after exponentiation and gauge commuting. Both real sign branches are executed without fitting: the dual sign `s_e=-1` exactly replays frozen A72, while `s_e=+1` gives `K1/K2=1.92731946`; both retain the same color ratio and positive weights. The A51 universal tree rows fix both relative boundary directions at the adopted one-shared-`P_EW` tier. No continuous ratio parameter remains, but one binary lepton sign and strict microscopic spectral-action completeness remain open.
- **A79** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ChargedLeptonDualMetricSignAndSpectralActionCompleteness_v1.md`: Proves a sign no-go: one ungraded completely monotone response to positive q/e closure costs cannot attenuate colored sectors while enhancing the charged-lepton lane. It constructs the unique active-support grading `J_anchor=P_colored-P_e=diag(1,1,1,0,-1,0)`, with `J_anchor^2=P_colored+P_e`; acting on A77's positive magnitude vector reproduces the required A72 correction exactly with zero continuous parameters. ProtoSpinor supplies the underlying classification labels (quarks partially anchored, charged leptons fully anchored/opposed-loop) but does not prove that the physical gauge action inserts this grading. The strict frontier is therefore one orientation/anchoring-parity insertion law or an independent kinetic Gram derivation, plus action completeness and absolute normalization.
- **A80** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_AnchoringParityInsertionLaw_or_IndependentKineticGramDerivation_v1.md`: Removes the apparent need for an indefinite anchoring grading. Gauge ratios are invariant under `C -> C+cI`, so `delta_q P_colored-delta_e P_e` is equivalent to the positive-semidefinite representative `delta_q P_colored+delta_e(I-P_e)`. This is the Hessian of the canonical projector-defect functional `(delta_e/2)||(I-P_e)x||^2+(delta_q/2)||P_colored x||^2`; within `span{I,P_colored,P_e}` it is uniquely fixed by the full-anchor kernel and partial-anchor excess. Executing the positive representative reproduces A78 with residual `4.44e-16`, and both continuous and discrete sign-parameter counts are zero. A79's fixed-representative no-go remains valid. Strict promotion still requires the selected product action to map the rank-one Lens anchor response contravariantly to this complement defect and prove spectator/counterterm neutrality; zero strict gauge values are accepted.
- **A81** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_FullAnchorDefectHessianActionOwnershipAndSpectatorCancellation_v1.md`: Closes the rank-one-anchor-to-complement bridge. Multiplication by the selected quarter character unitarily recenters the invariant `Z4` rank-three complement on the physical Lens anchor with zero residual, while the canonical projective tangent metric has Hessian `I-Q_quarter`. The unique unital center map satisfying `Phi(Q_quarter)=P_e` forces `Phi(I-Q_quarter)=I-P_e`, so the positive Lens tangent defect emits A80's charged-sector complement without a sign or continuous parameter. Six computable spectator classes are ratio-neutral. This does not yet prove completeness for sector-resolved noncentral blocks or A75 counterterms, and the baseline coefficients `3` and `14/3` still require a same-action multiplicity source; zero strict gauge values are accepted.
- **A82** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_BaselineCostMultiplicitySourceAndNoncentralSpectatorExclusion_v1.md`: Replaces A69's conditional multiplicity clues by a later-authority finite construction. The closed q79 ambient carrier is `Z1344 ~= Z64 x Z7 x Z3`, and the later Fu-Yau/Mukai certificate plus A77 close the full primitive seven-character orbit. Its family/odd marginal is `Z21 ~= Z3 x Z7`; dual-character invariance forces equal regular-trace weights and therefore exact multiplicities `3` and `7`, while A76 continues to forbid identifying the Lens-`Z4` augmentation with families. An explicit positive parent functional uses the selected quarter/conjugate opposed pair to give `(1/2)*3*(1^2+(-1)^2)=3`, and two-channel color Schur completion with `C2(3)=4/3` to give `7*(1/2)*(4/3)=14/3`. It replays A80 with zero residual and no parameters. Within the declared `{Q,u,d}`, `{e}`, `{L,N}` partition, every diagonal spectator is in `span{I,P_colored,P_e}`. Strict promotion still requires the selected MTT closure Hessian to equal this parent functional and restrict to A65's gauge-zero-mode Hessian, plus non-diagonal/loop spectator and A75 counterterm completeness; zero strict gauge values are accepted.
- **A83** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_SharedCircleClosureHessianToGaugeZeroModeRestrictionAndCountertermCompleteness_v1.md`: Executes the complete mathematical restriction. `W_kin=exp(-tau_int H_cl)Phi_C1^+` is an explicit positive-definite `18x18` family/sector density with minimum eigenvalue `0.0436756347`; because the density acts on the family factor and the gauge representation is `I3_family tensor rho_16`, it is gauge commuting. Its finite covariant trace Hessian `K_ab=Tr_HF(W_kin T_aT_b)` reproduces all three A80 kinetic rows and ratios with exactly zero residual. A logical-independence theorem prevents overpromotion: ProtoSpinor says closure cost is not a Lagrangian, the spectral-shadow paper assumes its proper-time action, A67 is source-axiom conditional, and A75 leaves two relative matching directions. A single explicit `ClosureShadowGaugeActionAxiom` with heat-shadow and finite-matching-completeness clauses is sufficient to close all three rows, current spectators and counterterms conditionally, with zero new numerical parameters and only the existing `P_EW` primitive. It is written and tested but not derived or adopted here; unconditional strict gauge values remain zero and held-out validation must follow any freeze.
- **A84** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_ClosureShadowGaugeActionAxiomDerivation_or_ExplicitAdoptionAndHeldOutValidation_v1.md`: Derives A83's heat-shadow clause at the existing fixed-point-gradient-flow plus regime-local unified-action tier. The fixed-point damping theorem identifies the closure Hessian as the linearized stabilization generator and uniquely emits `exp(-tau H)`; the selected time obeys `exp(-15 tau_int)=1/448` with residual `4.34e-19`. The ten-dimensional action places `J(s)` in the action potential and coherent reduction emits finite internal overlap coefficients. Since `H_cl` is sector-central, `[H_cl,Phi_C1]=0` exactly and `Phi_C1^(1/2)exp(-tau H_cl)Phi_C1^(1/2)=exp(-tau H_cl)Phi_C1` with residual `3.81e-15`, exactly A83's density. Thus CSGA1 no longer needs adoption at this action tier. Only CSGA2 remains: prove complete microscopic/heavy-sector matching adds no independent relative gauge-quadratic term, or explicitly adopt that finite boundary. A78 already supplies it conditionally at the adopted one-primitive/profile standard; strict unconditional gauge values remain zero, and A67 strict source plus `P_EW` and held-out validation remain downstream upgrades.
- **A85** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_FiniteMatchingCompletenessFromUnifiedAction_or_ExplicitBoundaryAdoptionAndHeldOutValidation_v1.md`: Splits A84's CSGA2 into bare source completeness and renormalized-scheme freedom. The corpus spectral-action theorem, together with the selected exact finite projected algebra, identifies the bare source as `S_N=P_EW Tr_N f_tau(D_A^2)`. A nonzero rank-two relative `F_a^2` vector would define a different action rather than an omitted term inside `S_N`, so bare CSGA2 closes at the corpus spectral-action tier. The MTT QFT corpus separately retains finite local counterterm freedom; the selected multi-loop common scheme closes that freedom at the current profile tier, not at the primitive-core no-knob tier. Both action clauses are therefore closed at the declared current standard with zero new numerical parameters. The action and authority hashes are frozen, but the known gauge profile is not mislabeled held out.
- **A86** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_PhiC1PositiveDensityPromotionFromClosedRouteASource_or_StrictGaugeRows_v1.md`: Supersedes A67's stale axiom-conditional source label using the later premise-free Route-A source theorem already present in the repository. PSM-C1-02 and `A_selected` are promoted, and the same-source dynamic theorem explicitly back-promotes `I+Z` and `I+X`. The canonical basis-covariant positive Gram functor `G(M)=MM^*` and fixed incidence pullback therefore promote `Phi_C1^+` with zero packet residual and basis-covariance residual `2.27e-16`, without a new source axiom or parameter. Combined with A84-A85, all three finite gauge-action rows and the two relative shape coordinates are accepted at the corpus-action source tier. The existing repository `P_EW` source row is imported separately. Primitive-core no-assumption gauge rows remain zero until the spectral-action proper-time premise and renormalized condition are derived from primitive MTT, and prospective held-out validation remains future work.
- **A87** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_GaugeActionCoefficientToCommonSchemeCouplingMapAndProspectiveValidation_v1.md`: Closes the convention-safe map from A86's finite kinetic shape to the selected SMDR common scheme. The established product-triple convention is `g_i^-2=c K_i`, with `K2=1` and `c=6f0=g2^-2`; `P_EW=A_EW` is separately typed in the H/threshold lane and is not substituted for `c`. One SMDR `g2` anchor then predicts both relative couplings: `g1=0.462943380859` and `g3=1.16342671597`. Propagating the full SMDR covariance, including the common `g2` anchor and `g1=sqrt(5/3)gY`, gives pulls `-0.00239 sigma` and `-0.000171 sigma`, with correlated `chi2=5.73e-6` for two coordinates. This is an exact convention closure and covariance-aware compatibility replay, not independent held-out evidence because the gauge profile was known during construction. At the corpus-action tier, three ordinary gauge coordinates reduce structurally to one common continuous kinetic anchor; the two ratio predictions, scheme, scale, hashes, statistic, rejection threshold and no-retuning rule are now frozen for prospective validation. Primitive-core derivation of `c` remains open.
- **A88** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_CommonKineticNormalizationScaleSymmetryNoGo_and_CrossSectorActionExit_v1.md`: Proves the remaining gauge normalization freedom is exactly one-dimensional at the current hashed corpus-action tier. For fixed positive `K`, the orbit `c->a c` sends every `g_i` to `a^(-1/2)g_i` and leaves both selected ratios invariant; the executed orbit has zero ratio residual and rank-one logarithmic amplitude Jacobian. Normalized trace/filter/support data therefore cannot identify `c`. The QG geometric Bernstein measure fixes a probability/filter mass of one and a support gap, but `A mu_prob` has the same normalized law and support for every `A>0`; it cannot be identified with the physical spectral-action measure without an additional theorem. The QM Born normalization similarly cancels its overall constant. An explicit countermodel corrects the twistor corpus: Fubini--Study normalization fixes `I_F=2pi` and the relation `g_eff^-2=I_F/g_tw^2`, but `g_tw->2g_tw` preserves all fiber data and divides the inverse effective coupling by four. Thus one common profile anchor is necessary and sufficient now, while zero-anchor closure requires a typed modal-unit-instanton action quantum, independently selected twistor action amplitude, or selected non-probability spectral-action total mass. No current source witness supplies one, and no new parameter is introduced.
- **A89** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_UnitInstantonToModalActionQuantumBridge_or_TwistorCouplingSource_v1.md`: Closes the exact topological-charge/action-amplitude factorization `S_YM(F_k)=8pi^2 c|k|`: Chern--Weil integrality selects `k`, while the positive CP-even coefficient `c` remains multiplicative; theta periodicity does not quantize it. The newest QA/SU3 theorem is imported correctly: `N_alpha1(h_ext)=1` is now a selected normalized tangent/source-strength value, but it is not a physical action amplitude. The q79 `ch2=4 alpha1` row remains an integral bundle candidate rather than a selected HYM source, so the two labels cannot be composed as one action. The strongest integer-level hypothesis is nevertheless executed: the selected cost `15`, displayed `+i/-i` pair and candidate `k=4` give `N=120` and `c=15/(2pi)=2.38732414638`, which misses A87 by `1205.64 ppm`. Its one-loop equality scale `185.382 GeV` is an inverse fit, not selected. Since ProtoSpinor says closure cost is not a Lagrangian and Euclidean Yang--Mills kinetic action is not forced into `2pi` integer units, the near-hit is rejected. The gauge sector is now frozen as closed at the adopted one-shared-primitive standard: two selected relative coordinates plus one common profile anchor, with zero new parameters; zero-anchor work resumes only on receipt of a genuinely new typed action-amplitude witness.
- **A90** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_PostA89MinimalParameterLedger_and_NextFrontier_v1.md`: Supersedes the old `18/24` minimal-coordinate ledger at the adopted profile/prediction-profile standard. A87-A89 replace the three gauge coordinates by one common anchor, reducing the count by two. A14 removes the source-owned CKM angle coordinates `s12,s13,s23`; the q79 CP phase remains a compatible postcheck rather than an accepted phase prediction, so one CKM coordinate remains. The current effective count is therefore `13` non-neutrino coordinates excluding QCD theta: one gauge anchor, nine charged-Yukawa magnitude profile coordinates, one CKM phase, one electroweak scale and one separately typed shared `P_EW` primitive. Adding the minimal six-coordinate PMNS policy gives `19`. These are effective model-coordinate counts, not independent prospective-evidence or strict zero-knob counts. The 12/12 baseline remains locked; the next active strict upgrade is U5 neutral completion through a selected determinant-line phase, native 10D mass scale and same-source Dirac/Majorana/order decision.
- **A91** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralDeterminantLineAPSOperator_and_Native10DMassScale_v1.md`: Corrects the U5 determinant-line source typing. The actual selected internal topology is `S1_cen x L(3,1) x Nil3`; `15` and `16` are selected Z64 cost/retarded labels, not selected Lens parameters or mapping-torus data. A41's `1/240` identity remains exact but is the universal Dedekind reciprocity remainder `1/(15*16)`. Treating `(16,15)` as an `SL(2,Z)` bottom row leaves the infinite family `gamma_t=[[15+16t,14+15t],[16,15]]` with Rademacher invariant `15+t`, so neither monodromy nor phase normalization is selected. The native 10D action supplies the correct structural domain but explicitly leaves the internal metric, Dirac spectrum, Wilson line and overlaps uncomputed; its existing 10D attenuation candidate misses the neutral profile by a factor `200707.62806`. The strict determinant-line source contract is now `2/10`, with no new parameter: construct the explicit twisted neutral Dirac family on the actual selected topology before attempting phase or scale promotion. A40 remains the closed two-primitive neutral profile and A41 remains conditional target-ranked one-scale compatibility only.
- **A92** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralRecursiveSharedCircleDiracDomainAndSpinBranchReduction_v1.md`: Reconciles the shared-circle warning with native 10D. The shorthand `S1_cen x L(3,1) x Nil3` cannot be a literal product because that would be seven internal dimensions. The corpus instead makes `S1_cen` the reused circle fiber of the lens layer, so the smooth representative is `X6=L(3,1)xNil3` and the rank census is `1+2+3=6`. `L(3,1)` has one spin structure, the standard Heisenberg nilmanifold has four, and the explicit balanced `SU(3)` coframe supplies one framing-induced candidate. The smooth product neutral Dirac family is constructed `6/6`. A flat lens-fiber character can only give cube roots of unity and the nil center is killed by every one-dimensional character, so neither can source a nonzero small neutral phase. Physical metric/flux/spin/Wilson-loop selection remains open.
- **A93** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralLensNilDeterminantHolonomyExecution_or_OneScaleFinality_v1.md`: Separates two previously conflated objects. A38 needs the ordinary flavor determinant line `det(E_nu)`, whose holonomy is `det H_nu`; the Quillen/Bismut-Freed analytic line `Det(D_nu)` has eta/mapping-torus holonomy and is not the same line without a new index/transgression theorem. Fixing the selected traceless `SU(3)` family connection leaves the exact central-lift family `A_phi=A0+i phi alpha I3`, with unchanged curvature and relative holonomy but `det Hol(A_phi)=exp(3i phi)`. Therefore one central holonomy scalar is necessary and sufficient, and cannot be selected by the existing topology/curvature/qutrit data. Current corpus and cross-repo source routes are exhausted at this boundary. The A40 two-splitting profile is exactly reparameterized as one geometric holonomy plus one mass scale, with no coordinate-count reduction and no new parameter. Strict phase/scale prediction remains open.
- **A94** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_NeutralOneHolonomyOneScaleOntologyClosure_and_U5TierDecision_v1.md`: Closes U5 at the explicitly adopted one-holonomy plus one-scale profile standard. A Majorana block preserved by the same central holonomy exists only at the self-conjugate points `phi=0` or `pi/3` modulo `2pi/3`, matching the earlier `Z1344` self-character gate. The executed A40 phase and conditional A41 phase are non-self-conjugate, so the same-source profile is Dirac-only. The chamber `0<|phi|<pi/6` selects normal ordering; the `+phi/-phi` pair has the same sorted spectrum and only exchanges low-family labels. With the declared nil minimal-trace boundary and one mass scale, all 36 A40 rows follow. The minimal PMNS count remains six: three angles, one Dirac CP phase, one holonomy shape and one scale. Strict no-knob U5 remains open at the holonomy value, absolute scale, nil-source promotion and covariance; at the accepted 1-3 primitive policy, U5 leaves the active frontier and work moves to U9.
- **A95** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_PostU5TierLedger_and_U9GlobalBranchMeasure_v1.md`: Closes U9 at the selected antiunitary-orbit plus retarded conditional-measure standard. The transitive two-member orbit `{q79/F/m1,q369/F*/m2}` has the unique antiunitary-invariant probability measure `(1/2,1/2)`. Conditioning on the independently selected retarded orientation gives q79 probability one; the advanced orientation gives q369 probability one. No observed CP sign or new parameter enters, and the conjugate remains part of the unoriented theory rather than a second tunable universe. Strict uniqueness across every possible MTT carrier is not overclaimed: the complete carrier set, quotient, sigma algebra/topology, measure/action, existence theorem and full-support proof are all undefined (`0/6`). At the adopted tier the upgrade ledger is `4 closed / 4 partial / 1 dependency-blocked`; the strict ledger remains `2 / 6 / 1`. The next active internal target is U6 flux/threshold axion-current anomaly matching.
- **A96** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_FluxThresholdAxionCurrentAnomalyMatchingMap_v1.md`: Corrects the U6 threshold route by anomaly matching. Pure `Q_psi` has light anomaly `+12`, heavy `10_-2` contribution `-12`, and total zero. The symmetry-preserving mass operator `1_4 10_-2 10_-2` cannot make the anomaly disappear: integrating out the heavy colored states emits the compensating Wess-Zumino term, so exotic decoupling alone cannot promote the matter-only trace or `N_DW=3` diagnostic to a PQ solution. The q79 branch does supply selected 10D Green-Schwarz/Bianchi curvature support, but its order-three gerbe representative is flat with de Rham `H=0`; neither object is yet the 4D axion-current coupling. The lawful final map is `J_PQ=J_psi+sum c_I J_I+f_a da_GS` with `A_eff=A_light+A_WZ+A_GS`. Its ten final reduction/current/normalization/quality fields remain `0/10`. U6 is open, but its false threshold shortcut is closed and the next object is the selected 4D Green-Schwarz axion reduction.
- **A97** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_4DGreenSchwarzAxionReductionAndSurvivingCurrent_v1.md`: Supersedes A96's `0/10` frontier. The selected compact oriented q79 heterotic background emits the model-independent axion `theta_MI=2pi integral_X6 B6`, dual to the spacetime two-form. Reduction gives `f_MI^2=g_s^2 l_s^4/(2pi Vol X6)` and `f_MI=alpha_GUT M_Pl/sqrt(8pi^2)` without adding an independent axion parameter; an absolute no-knob value is still forbidden without the existing dimensional anchor. Exact adjoint-trace calculations give `I(E8->E6)=I(E6->SU3c)=1`, hence primitive color coupling `k3=N_DW=1`. The axion has its own shift current and does not reuse the anomaly-free Qpsi matter current. The map advances to `9/10`; only non-QCD quality remains.
- **A98** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_AxionQualityInstantonSuppressionBound_v1.md`: Closes perturbative axion quality exactly and proves a non-linearized global-minimum certificate. For `DeltaV=-sum Lambda_j^4 cos(n_j theta+delta_j)`, define `M0=sum Lambda_j^4`, `M1=sum |n_j|Lambda_j^4`, and `M2=sum n_j^2 Lambda_j^4`; the sufficient conditions `M1<chi_QCD sin epsilon`, `M2<chi_QCD cos epsilon`, and `2M0<chi_QCD(1+cos epsilon)` force the unique global minimum inside `epsilon` of the CP-conserving point. The selected hidden-gauge/NS5/worldsheet source payload is `0/9`, so this is an executable final test rather than quality closure. External scale diagnostics require instanton actions around 181-190 for `epsilon=1e-10`, but those are not selected predictions.
- **A99** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79MultiAxionSupersetAndHiddenBlindDirection_v1.md`: Applies the superset strategy to U6. The Leray-Serre sequence for a nontrivial Fu-Yau principal `T2` bundle over K3 gives `b2=22-r` for torus-Chern rank `r=1,2`, hence at least 20 model-dependent modes and 21 total pre-lifting axion candidates. The heterotic `X8` polynomial conditionally yields opposite visible/hidden model-dependent coupling rows and an exact hidden-E8-blind QCD direction; the general necessary-and-sufficient test is `rank(K_nonQCD)<N` and `rank(stack(K_nonQCD,k_QCD))>rank(K_nonQCD)`. This implication is proved, but its selected same-source coupling lattice, gauged quotient and NS5/worldsheet zero-mode antecedent remain `0/6`. U6 therefore remains `9/10`, not fully closed.
- **A100** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79AxionCouplingLatticeAndNS5WorldsheetZeroModePacket_v1.md`: Supersedes A99's flat-hidden conditional. For `v_i=int beta_i tr F1_bar^2`, `h_i=int beta_i tr F2_bar^2`, and source-free Bianchi `r_i=v_i+h_i`, the full structural `E8 x E8` rows are `k_vis=(1,+3(v-h))` and `k_hid=(1,-3(v-h))` without assuming a flat hidden bundle. Together with the primitive wrapped-NS5 row `k_NS5=(1,0)`, the exact identity `k_vis+k_hid=2k_NS5` proves that no axion direction can be blind to both hidden condensation and NS5 breaking while retaining QCD coupling. The selected NS5 wrapped cycle, harmonic and action formula `S_NS5=2pi/alpha_GUT` close structurally (`2/9`), while numerical amplitudes remain `0/9`. A rational Fu-Yau worldsheet lift must pair trivially with both torus Chern classes and pass the isolated-curve/Pfaffian kernel test. Independently of those values, a worldsheet-only potential cannot displace strong CP because the primitive surviving universal axion minimizes the QCD angle for every fixed model-dependent configuration. The direct U6 frontier is now the selected hidden-`E8` confinement decision plus the NS5 amplitude bound; U6 remains `9/10`.
- **A101** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79HiddenE8ConfinementAndNS5QualityAmplitudeCertificate_v1.md`: Audits the actual MTT Strominger source and proves that its one-connection functional does not type or select both physical `E8` bundles. The exact repair replaces `A` by `(A1,A2)`, sums both Chern-Simons/Bianchi/Yang-Mills terms and extends the gauge Hessian blockwise; `P2` remains source data rather than being silently identified with the q79 Mukai pair. The hidden phase is now governed by an exact decision theorem using `(P2,rho2)`, the `248` branching, bundle cohomology, thresholds and `f_hidden`; `b0>0` alone is explicitly not promoted to confinement. A new exhaustive `E8` result proves `min[q1^2+q2^2-|q1.q2|]=30` for any two cocharacters with no common orthogonal root. Minkowski reduction lifts this to `k2>=30` for any two independent integral ASD K3 classes, ruling out complete hidden-`E8` abelianization using only the two Fu-Yau circle curvatures in the smooth source-free 24-unit branch. The NS5 prefactor is refined exactly to `A_NS5=kappa/(16*pi*alpha_GUT)` and both superpotential and Kahler A98 envelopes are executable. No continuous parameter is added; the selected `P2`, its spectrum and seven numerical NS5 inputs remain open.
- **A102** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79HiddenBundleExistenceBianchiAllocationAndSpectrumExecution_v1.md`: Constructs and audits the strongest exact source-free hidden-bundle candidate found so far. The q79 Mukai block has unique primitive determinant-free combination `3a-b=(8,0,-1)`, but Yoshioka's classification makes it all-non-locally-free; the primitive repair `(9,0,-2)` has `c2=11` and stable locally free representatives, while the numerical `q7=2` to length-two ideal-sheaf bridge remains unselected. A primitive K3 class `delta^2=-4` is the minimal nonzero ASD cost compatible with an ample class, giving the exact conditional Fu-Yau allocation `9+11+4=24`. Stable locally free `SU3,c2=9` and `SU9,c2=11` HYM bundles exist. Deleting affine `E8` node 2 gives the exact `A8` embedding `SU(9)/Z3`, branching `248=80+84+bar84`, and cohomology `38+63+63=164`, matching `2(30*11-248)`; full `SU9` holonomy would leave only finite `Z3` and remove hidden condensation. The same audit proves a crucial no-go: a visible bundle pulled back from K3 has `c3=0`, hence zero net four-dimensional chiral index, so its three K3 slots are not three net families. The remaining source cutset is the shared-circle-to-rank-one-Fu-Yau bridge, a stable non-pullback visible `SU3` bundle with `integral c3=+/-6`, selected full hidden holonomy, and the seven A101 NS5 values. No fitted continuous parameter is added, but 76 complex reduced bundle-moduli directions remain unselected.
- **A103** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79NonPullbackChiralVisibleBundleAndFullSU9HolonomySelection_v1.md`: Closes the A102 hidden-holonomy conditional. Every stable `SU9,c2=11` bundle on the selected K3 has full `SU9` HYM holonomy: K3 parity excludes `SO9`, while sharp stable (possibly Brauer-twisted) Mukai bounds exclude `Sym8(SU2)` and the `3x3` tensor case. The hidden `E8` commutant is finite `Z3`, so there is no continuous hidden gauge factor or hidden gaugino condensate; the 38 complex bundle moduli and their threshold dependence remain. A103 also withdraws the old printed Iwasawa `c3=6` source because its alleged Chern form is nonclosed, its displayed Dolbeault connection is nonintegrable, and its global trivial frame has zero Chern classes. On the actual rank-one Fu-Yau topology it constructs smooth shared-circle clutching `SU3` bundles with `c3=+/-6`; independently, the q79 genus-two map constructs a determinant-zero degree-three spectral cover with sectioned-reference `c3=6`. Holomorphic gerbe lift, balanced HYM and same-branch Bianchi remain open.
- **A104** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79TwistedSpectralGerbeLiftHYMAndBianchiExecution_v1.md`: Computes the same-branch spectral surface and integral gerbe gate. For `C in |H+3[0]| subset K3 x E`, adjunction, Noether and Lefschetz give `K_C^2=18`, `c2(C)=90`, `chi(O_C)=9`, `q=1`, `p_g=9`, `h11=74`, and `H^3(C,Z)=Z^2`. The standard dual-Poincare Dixmier-Douady class is `delta cup u`; both restriction pairings are proportional to the exact q79 lattice product `delta.H=0`, so `DD(alpha)|C=0` integrally, with no torsion loophole. The remaining obstruction is one topologically trivial holomorphic gerbe class `beta_C`, not nine fitted parameters. A rank-one twisted spectral sheaf, inverse Fourier-Mukai transform, HYM and Bianchi are not promoted without deciding that class.
- **A105** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79NormalizedPoincareGerbeAndPGL3PrymReduction_v1.md`: Reduces A104's analytic gate to a finite square system. The degree-three divisor sequence gives `p_*O_C=O_K3 direct_sum phi_H^*Omega^1_P2`, splitting `H^2(C,O_C)` as trace dimension `1` plus Prym dimension `8`. Zero-section normalization uniquely removes the base-Brauer lift ambiguity, and Poincare biextension additivity plus `y1+y2+y3=0` kills the trace/norm of `beta_C`. Serre duality and `phi_H*O_K3=O direct_sum O(-3)` identify the remaining obstruction tangent with `pgl3^*`. Thus the unfixed `PGL3` alignment and the fibers of the relative Prym-gerbe torus form one exact local `8x8` Cech/period Jacobian problem after a Gauss-Manin/holomorphic trivialization. No zero or determinant is invented: the next execution must evaluate the normalized Poincare cocycle on a marked same-branch K3/elliptic geometry and certify a transverse zero or no-go.
- **A106** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79PGL3ToPrymGerbeJacobianExecution_v1.md`: Derives the missing marked geometry and exact gerbe equations. The lattice roots `H+/-delta` force a splitting conic and the normal form `w^2=G3^2+Q2 H4`, whose quotient family has exactly 18 complex moduli. The analytic gerbe zero is an integral-period congruence `F_r=z_r-sum_I Pi_rI ell_I=0` on one `ell in Z^92` branch, not eight floating zeros. Residue calculus gives the eight trace-free forms and the full covariant `8x8` Jacobian `J_rs=nabla_s z_r-sum_I ell_I nabla_s Pi_rI`. The former eight beta and 64 Jacobian entries are derived outputs, leaving one marked K3 point and one elliptic modulus as geometric source data.
- **A107** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79MarkedK3EllipticPeriodSourceAndGerbeZeroExecution_v1.md`: Proves that the single Fu-Yau Chern pair `(delta,0)` has a parabolic `SL2Z` stabilizer with no order-four element, retiring the direct lens-quarter-turn-to-`tau=i` shortcut. The minimal lawful quarter-turn parent is the four-orientation Chern orbit. Conditional selection of that parent gives a global order-four fiber automorphism, fixes `tau=i` and `j=1728`, and makes one gerbe execution covariant across all four branches. The typed MTT-to-Chern-orbit bridge remains open, so the strict source count is still 19 complex moduli and falls to 18 only conditionally.
- **A108** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79SplittingConicK3PeriodSelectorOrExactGerbeExecution_v1.md`: Reconciles the older Strominger fixed-point paper with its actual variables: it fixes `X,J,E` and topology before varying `g,Phi,B,A`, so it is a conditional fixed-sector correspondence and contains no K3-period selector. Its OU term is inconsistently treated as both constant and moduli-lifting, and its `epsilon^-2` fiber metric sends fiber eigenvalues to zero rather than proving a uniform gap. After isolating the repaired field-Hessian assumptions, A108 proves the correct period reduction `H_eff=H_pp-H_pu H_uu^-1 H_up` on 36 real K3 directions. At conditional `tau=i`, this joins A106 into a square 52-real-equation period-plus-gerbe system with determinant `det(H_eff)*|det_C(D_A F)|^2` in the triangular complex-linear case and the full realified gerbe determinant otherwise. Seven actual period derivative fields and an exact solution remain open; no fitted parameter or marked point is invented.
- **A109** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79K3PeriodDomainXiHessianExecutionOrMarkedModelGerbeCertificate_v1.md`: Executes A108's constructive alternative with explicit rational `Q2,G3,H4`. Over `QQ`, four exact Groebner ideal tests reduce to `[1]` on every chart `x=1,y=1,z=1`, proving the conic and sextic smooth, the six `Q2-G3` intersections transverse, and `H4` nonzero there. The split lifts realize the primitive q79 marking `Gram(H,delta)=diag(2,-4)`. This fills 4/8 strict direct-model fields, or 5/8 only under A107's still-open Z4 `tau=i` bridge. It proves nonemptiness and supplies an exact test carrier but removes zero strict source moduli; the rational point is not promoted to an MTT-selected vacuum.
- **A110** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79ExplicitModelRelativeDeligneGerbeZeroOrNoGoExecution_v1.md`: Extends A109 to the algebraic square elliptic cubic and trial identity alignment. A mutual-Gauss singularity reduction has unit ideal on all nine product charts, proving the spectral surface smooth. A nine-patch Cartier presentation of `O(delta)` supplies 72 exact inverse and 729 exact triple-cocycle checks. Local logarithms give the unique holomorphic Fu-Yau elliptic torsor with Chern pair `(delta,0)`, and the normalized Poincare gerbe has explicit scalar formula `alpha_ijk(e_hat)=chi_ehat(n_ijk,0)`. This closes three previously null A104 formula fields. Good-cover branch values, the additive `beta_C`, eight Prym periods, `Z^92` membership and exact zero/no-go remain open; trial `tau=i` and `A=I` are not source-selected.
- **A111** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoLefschetzPeriodReduction_v1.md`: Replaces A110's unspecified surface-period integration by an exact genus-two Lefschetz fibration over the square elliptic curve. On `b^2=a^3-a`, every fiber is `u^2=f_ab(t)=g_ab^2+q_ab h_ab`. Exact elimination gives `Disc_t(f_ab)=P45(a)+b Q43(a)`; the elliptic norm has degree 90, `gcd(N90,N90')=1`, and no zero at infinity, proving exactly 90 nodal fibers and independently reproducing `c2(C)=90`, `b2(C)=92`. The eight `sl3` residue numerators and the degree-zero splitting divisor `D_delta=P_1+P_2-P_infinity_plus-P_infinity_minus` are emitted explicitly. The remaining beta calculation is now one rank-four inhomogeneous genus-two Gauss-Manin/normal-function execution with integral Picard-Lefschetz monodromy. The certified `8x92` periods, beta vector, integral branch and zero/no-go remain open; no source modulus is removed.
- **A112** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoCriticalValueAndNodeIsolation_v1.md`: Certifies every A111 critical value and nodal point. Exact-integer MPSolve input gives 90 pairwise-disjoint isolating disks with status `Isolated, None, In`; 8 meet the real axis and the other 82 form 41 conjugate pairs, independently checked by exact Sturm isolation and decimal-rational disk separation. Each disk has the unique elliptic lift `b_j=-P45(a_j)/Q43(a_j)`. The degree-one fiber subresultant gives `t_j=-c0(a_j,b_j)/c1(a_j,b_j)`, and an exact coprimality certificate proves `c1` is nonzero on every critical value, closing all 90 nodal lifts. No monodromy matrix or beta period is inferred: certified paths, integral `Sp(4,Z)` Picard-Lefschetz matrices, the `8x92` periods, integral branch and zero/no-go remain open; no source modulus is removed.
- **A113** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoBasedPathSystemAndMonodromyCandidate_v1.md`: Places A112 on the normalized square torus with exact regular four-torsion base point `(a,b)=(-i,1+i)`. The 90 critical disks lift to pairwise-disjoint torus balls; explicit positive-clearance outbound segments and circles certify one based meridian per puncture. A113 also identifies and certifies the two `A/B` torus-handle carriers required by the genus-one base, so the computational path inventory is 92 rather than 90. A frozen FLINT branch transport emits 90 candidate local matrices: every root permutation is a transposition, every raw braid word replays exactly to an integral `Sp(4,Z)` rank-one transvection, and the candidate vanishing cycles span rank 4. Promotion remains `0/90`: continuous disjoint root tubes, the `A/B` handle matrices, an ordered distinguished cut system and the global surface relation remain open. No period row or source modulus is added.
- **A114** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoHandleMonodromyPromotion_v1.md`: Promotes the two nonlocal torus-handle monodromies in the frozen genus-two marking. FLINT/Arb Rouche tests certify six pairwise-disjoint continuous root tubes over all 6,928 `A` segments and 5,004 `B` segments. An independent 80-digit interval projection certifies all 74 braid crossings, crossing signs, same-segment event orders and endpoint permutations. Birman-Hilden half-twist lifting plus exact chain-twist replay gives two noncommuting integral `Sp(4,Z)` matrices and their symplectic commutator. This does not promote the 90 local candidates: their continuous trajectories, an ordered distinguished cut system, the punctured-torus surface relation, `8x92` periods and beta vector remain open. No period row or source modulus is added.
- **A115** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoLocalMonodromyPromotion_v1.md`: Promotes all 90 local Picard-Lefschetz monodromies in the same frozen genus-two marking. The exact A113 based meridians are transported in a certified branch-chart atlas (`s_0=1/t`, with `s_{-1}=1/(t+1)` on two chart-boundary paths); independently certified transition braids conjugate every action back to the A114 marking. Arb Rouche tubes certify all 300,428 saved local path segments, and an 80-digit interval audit certifies all 2,392 crossings, including the 77 multi-event segments. Every independently reconstructed integral matrix equals its A113 frozen candidate, so the promoted inventory is now 90 local plus two handle actions, and the local vanishing cycles span rank four. The ordered distinguished cut system, punctured-torus surface relation, `8x92` periods, beta vector, integral branch and covariant gerbe zero/no-go remain open. No period row or source modulus is added.
- **A116** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoDistinguishedCutSystemAndGlobalSurfaceRelation_v1.md`: Closes the global integral first-homology Gauss-Manin factorization. Cutting the normalized torus along A114's promoted `A/B` carriers gives a square containing all 90 critical disks. A strictly angle-ordered radial fan has certified positive arc/circle clearances and is an ordered distinguished cut system, rather than a root-id product. Independent FLINT/Arb transport over those 90 new loops certifies 229,436 continuous root-tube segments and 3,476 interval braid crossings; all 90 positive Picard-Lefschetz factors are promoted and their vanishing cycles span rank four. In the measured left-action convention the exact product is `M_90...M_1=B^-1 A^-1 B A`, closing the punctured-torus surface relation in `Sp(4,Z)`. Full mapping-class faithfulness is not claimed. The `8x92` Prym period rows, integral `Z^92` branch and covariant gerbe zero/no-go remain open. No period row or source modulus is added.
- **A117** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoIntegralSurfaceCyclePresentation_v1.md`: Retains the saturated rank-86 thimble-kernel calculation and the rational rank reconciliation `86+4+2=92`, while distinguishing transport paths from surface cycles. A119 supersedes its preliminary claim that the 86 thimble and four handle classes form a primitive integral direct sum: the selected central lift exposes an index-three handle-only defect that is removed by the full coupled thimble tails.
- **A118** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoCertifiedThimblePeriodExecution_v1.md`: Executes the analytic genus-two period engine on all 90 primitive distinguished thimbles. Its emitted 90-column primitive table and independent floating rerun remain valid. A119 supersedes the old interpretation of the separately assembled 86-column `T K` table: that table is now a reproducible convergence diagnostic, not the final integral `H2` block.
- **A119** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoHandleAndLerayPeriodExecution_v1.md`: Corrects and completes the integral period assembly. Independent holomorphic-period continuation selects central lifts `+A,-B` and aligns all 90 endpoint-chord orientations (38 positive, 52 negative; maximum scaled residual `1.29954e-8`). The selected-lift handle-only Smith diagonal is `(1,1,1,3)`, but attaching the exact thimble tails gives the full relation Smith diagonal `(1,1,1,1)` and a unimodular completion. The resulting exact rank-90 primary basis has 82 pure-thimble and eight handle-supported columns. A primitive ambient fiber/horizontal Leray pair supplies the final two integral classes; their 16 periods vanish exactly for the eight primitive `sl3` residues. The full floating `8x92` table is therefore assembled on an exact integral basis, with propagated two-run maximum column-scaled difference envelope `6.47849e-8`. Interval enclosure, the inhomogeneous beta vector, integral branch and gerbe zero/no-go remain open. No source modulus or fitted Standard-Model value enters.
- **A120** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoNormalFunctionBetaAndIntegralBranchExecution_v1.md`: Derives the exact balanced-sextic Mumford representative `(Q,V)` of the splitting divisor `P_1+P_2-infinity_+-infinity_-` and its inhomogeneous rank-four Gauss-Manin source. Numerical continuation selects handle translations `A=(2,-2,3,-5)` and `B=(1,-1,0,0)` on the A119 physical lifts `+A,-B`. Direct transport emits 88 local integral Picard-Lefschetz multiples; the exact affine punctured-torus relation uniquely completes the two pole-adjacent rows with `m_43=1,m_45=0`. The full 90-factor affine product equals the physical handle commutator exactly, with boundary translation `[7,6,-4,7]`. All 90 local singularity classes vanish, but the complete cocycle is not a common coboundary, so it represents a genuine global integral Leray class. This cocycle is not itself the additive Deligne period `z_8`: the normalized Poincare/Deligne pairing functional, exact integral branch and covariant beta zero/no-go remain open. No source modulus or fitted Standard-Model value enters.
- **A121** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79GenusTwoDeligneBetaPeriodAndIntegralBranchExecution_v1.md`: Uses the explicit first-circle marking `DD(alpha)=delta cup u_A` and the torus bilinear relation to identify the normalized quotient representative `beta_C=[R_B] in C^8/Pi(H^2(C,Z))`. All eight floating rows are emitted with maximum production/tight difference `5.92176e-10`. This closes the Deligne transgression functional, not exact `Z^92` membership, beta zero/nonzero, or a PGL3 zero.
- **A122** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79AlignedDivisorNormalFunctionSourceAndPGL3BranchDiagnosis_v1.md`: Proves the same-carrier aligned-divisor source theorem. For `ell=A(a,b,1)^T`, the aligned splitting divisor `q_A` supplies both roots and the implicit velocities `dt_i/dw=-(q_A,a da/dw+q_A,b db/dw)/q_A,t`; identity A121 is preserved up to the frozen common unit `-1`. Pre-fix nonidentity beta/Jacobian values are retired. Four fresh full-rank corrected Jacobians reduce `||beta||` from `5.110165` to `2.729845`, while two independent trajectories approach a nodal wall with latest projective beta overlap `0.989307`; 12 additional path-guarded carriers find no zero. These are floating diagnostics, not a global no-go or exact integral branch. The next lawful target is a Picard-Lefschetz residual theorem or a selected nonzero `Z^92` branch.
- **A123** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79ProjectiveLineChartCovarianceAndEllZeroContinuation_v1.md`: Preserves A122's exact aligned-source theorem but corrects its first floating wall diagnosis. Exact `z`/`y` projective line-chart covariance holds for `Q2,G3,H4,F6`, the moving residue one-forms and all five reduced periods; the period transition has determinant `-1`. The A122 raw gaps near `0.005` become regular-chart gaps `0.095842` and `0.127416`, so that first apparent node is a chart artifact. Transforming the already selected base lift preserves the same `ell=0` beta representative across charts to `1.312e-5` at production tolerance. Three fresh-Jacobian and two guarded Broyden steps continue `||beta||: 2.729845 -> 2.357980` and localize a later genuine branch pair at projective separation about `0.01202`. No zero or global no-go is claimed; the active target is an interval-certified one-sided Picard-Lefschetz residual or a selected nonzero `Z^92` branch.
- **A124** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79PicardLefschetzOneSidedResidualRegularization_v1.md`: Resolves the local geometry of A123's later wall. A coupled `f=f_t=0` solve has maximum residual `5.087e-12`, minimum real-Jacobian singular value `11.0736`, nonzero `f_tt`, regular normalized `y`-chart scale `0.874035`, selected-`q_A` divisor disjointness, and nonzero `Im(du_*/ds)`, giving a floating transverse simple node. A124 proves the exact local state `V_k=2*pi*i*t_*^k/sqrt(f_tt(t_*)/2)` and the transported Picard-Lefschetz jump theorem: the common inhomogeneous source cancels between the two same-lift continuations, so their difference is the homogeneous Gauss-Manin transport of `V`. Independently extrapolated selected/crossed beta norms are `2.357163/2.788073`; the transported and measured jumps have projective overlap `0.999999999999962` and relative residual `2.747e-7` after a scale within `1.16e-5` of unity. The formula is exact and the unit-jump execution is floating. Interval certification, a local selected-side nonzero theorem, the global `ell=0` no-go, and exact `Z^92` branch selection remain open.
- **A125** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79PicardLefschetzIntervalWallAndBaseLift_v1.md`: Promotes the genuine A124 wall and the finite selected-side Abel-Jacobi base lift to Arb/ACB interval scope. A radius-`1e-10` Krawczyk box has minimum strict-inclusion margin `6.385e-11`; whole-box bounds prove a unique transverse simple node, selected-divisor disjointness and regular `y` chart, with `|f_tt|>518938.3935`, `|q_A(t_*)|>0.2858552` and an `Im(du_*/ds)` interval excluding zero. The certified bound `|V_0|>0.012334923056187106` and invertibility of homogeneous Gauss-Manin transport prove a nonzero Picard-Lefschetz jump, hence the two one-sided beta limits cannot both vanish. At `s_-=0.23002676995574059`, `599` certified square-root-continuation segments and `2995` ACB integrals emit the five-component selected-side base lift with maximum ball radius `9.366e-48` and opposite-sheet cancellation below `5.176e-64`. A floating same-branch lower contour reduces conditioning by `17.62` while agreeing with straight transport to `1.454e-8`; this is not an interval transport certificate. Validated high-order selected-side endpoint beta transport, the global `ell=0` no-go and exact `Z^92` branch selection remain open.
- **A126** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79ValidatedBetaTransportAndFiniteFlatContourHomotopy_v1.md`: Closes the frozen selected-side endpoint beta and excludes its `ell=0` representative. A `1541`-leaf argument-principle cover of the local detour rectangle gives clockwise windings `(0,0,0,-1,0)` for the reduction determinant, `y`-chart scale, `Q2` leading coefficient, `Q2` discriminant and `G3` quotient norm. The one discriminant zero exchanges the two roots but does not break the normal function: `O[t]/(Q2)` remains finite flat of rank two, `G3` remains a unit, and `U=G3` is a symmetric degree-two Cartier divisor through the collision. Order-28 defect-corrected ACB transport closes in `160` accepted steps with endpoint component radius `0.03789568495` and rigorous `||beta(1)||_2>2.2500100575`. A separate full-strip computation has reduction/divisor windings `-4/-1` and is retired despite endpoint agreement. This is not a global PGL3 `ell=0` no-go and does not select a nonzero integral `Z^92` branch; the interval `8x92` period lattice is next.
- **A127** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79CovariantPeriodBranchCutsetAndTightBetaTransport_v1.md`: Tightens the same endpoint to component radius `0.0070601942734` and rigorous `||beta||_2>2.3372259957`, then corrects the integral-branch strategy. The exact equation requires `z(A)` and `Pi(A)` on the same carrier, so pairing A126 beta with A119's identity-alignment table is forbidden; conversely any complete endpoint integral basis suffices by `GL(92,Z)` basis invariance. A127 computes the exact 496-term degree-30 dual sextic discriminant and reproduces A111 exactly at identity. Its selected-alignment interval pullback has `P/Q` degrees `45/43`, a degree-90 norm with 90 disjoint simple roots, 90 elliptic lifts and three isolated line-chart zeros. It certifies a 90-meridian fan avoiding all critical, pole and chart-wall balls and computes 90 pointwise integral Picard-Lefschetz transvections in one common reciprocal branch chart. A128-A130 close A127's continuous-root-tube and endpoint-integral-basis obligations; A131 closes the same-carrier floating `8x92` period table, and A132 removes its exact primitive rank-two Leray-null redundancy. Exact effective `Z^90` membership survives from this stage. The frozen alignment remains a computational selected-side carrier, not an MTT source-selection theorem.
- **A128** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79AlignmentContinuousRootMonodromyPromotion_v1.md`: Promotes all 90 local Picard-Lefschetz actions on A127's selected carrier. Arb/ACB Rouché tubes certify `1,052,626` local path segments with minimum relative margin `2.8947210966e-7` and minimum pairwise tube separation `1.0135915873e-5`. An independent 80-digit interval projection certifies all local braid crossings and same-segment event orders before exact integral replay; all 90 matrices are integral symplectic transvections and their vanishing images span rank four. This closes continuous endpoint root transport, not the period values.
- **A129** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79AlignmentHandlesAndGlobalSurfaceRelation_v1.md`: Certifies both selected torus-handle transports, including disjoint root tubes and independently interval-certified braid words. Exact replay gives noncommuting integral symplectic handle matrices and closes `M_90...M_1=B^-1 A^-1 B A` with all 90 local factors positive and with no conjugation or fitted matrix. This closes the global selected-carrier first-homology factorization.
- **A130** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79AlignmentIntegralH2Presentation_v1.md`: Derives the selected handle central lifts directly from interval winding of the reciprocal sextic leading coefficient: winding `6` selects `+A` and winding `-5` selects `-B`. The selected vanishing map has Smith diagonal `(1,1,1,1)`; the coupled full relation presentation also has Smith diagonal `(1,1,1,1)` and a unimodular completion. It emits an exact primitive 90-column primary basis (82 pure thimbles and eight handle-supported columns) plus a primitive Leray hyperbolic pair, hence a complete rank-92 integral `H2` basis on the selected carrier. No period fit or observed value selects this basis. Same-carrier `8x92` periods and exact `Z^92` branch membership remain open. The frozen alignment remains a computational selected-side carrier, not an MTT source-selection theorem.
- **A131** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79AlignmentEightByNinetyTwoPeriodExecution_v1.md`: Executes the exact A123 aligned-residue formulas on the A127-A130 selected carrier. A fixed 257-point, period-blind conditioning scan selects 42 `y`-chart and 48 `z`-chart columns and lowers the worst equilibrated reduction condition to `4.023e7`. All 720 primitive complex period entries survive an independent tighter rerun with maximum scale-normalized difference `2.17175e-9`. Compact-holomorphic `H1` linearity uniquely synchronizes 40 numerical chord signs, with maximum residual `8.59997e-9`; the three meromorphic rows correctly retain puncture-at-infinity lift dependence. Independent continuation replays the interval-selected central lifts `+A,-B`, and exact A130 transport assembles the full selected-carrier floating `8x92` table. Its propagated primary column-scaled envelope is `1.654861e-9`, while the 16 Leray entries vanish exactly. A same-carrier LLL vector lies inside the current beta enclosure but is dense (support 87, height 17), so it is diagnostic rather than a selected integral branch. Interval enclosures for nonzero periods and exact `Z^92` membership remain open. The frozen alignment remains a computational selected-side carrier, not an MTT source-selection theorem.
- **A132** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_q79EffectiveIntegralBranchQuotientAndHeightFourSeed_v1.md`: Consumes A130-A131 without reopening them. Because the primitive Leray pair is an exact rank-two summand and all 16 of its trace-free residue periods vanish exactly, the branch equation factors through `Z^92/<Leray_F,Leray_Gamma0> = Z^90`; the two Leray coefficients are unidentifiable and may canonically be set to zero. This proves an effective `Z^90` search domain, not that the Leray pair is the full exact period kernel. A deterministic same-carrier Kannan grid emits 575 distinct candidates and a height-four continuation seed with maximum center residual `0.0055063875`, inside the rigorous beta component radius `0.0070601943`; height means integer cycle multiplicity, not four fitted parameters. The fixed search is not a global height theorem, and the overlap is not exact membership because the 720 nonzero A131 periods still have two-run rather than interval error bounds. The next theorem is the same-source covariant `F(A,m)=0` interval solve or a branch-separation certificate.
- **A22** `C:\Users\nero_\Downloads\TEXPAPERS\mtt-sm-parity-closure\proof_corpus\MTT_Selected_E6CentralGeneratorQCDAnomalyAudit_v1.md`: Computes the exact E6 Qpsi color-anomaly trace: three matter families contribute +12 and complete-27 exotics -12, so the full anomaly cancels. The matter-only/singlet diagnostic gives N_DW=3; strong-CP closure requires a selected flux/threshold axion-current anomaly-matching map.

- SM parity/profile work is no longer merely a benchmark: A04 closes embedded renormalized-SM equivalence at the declared one-shared-primitive/profile standard.
- QFT observable equivalence is closed on the embedded branch by A03, but quantization is imported rather than MTT-derived.
- The literal finite Cech witness is closed by A07; the literal global HYM connection remains open.
- The finite projected HYM connection is quantitatively stable by A15; only uniform continuum convergence and patchwise control remain before literal global-HYM closure.
- A19 consumes the A15 continuum remainder: the exact weighted-theta tail and Wiener contraction close continuum existence/local uniqueness and selected rank-two literal Cech-HYM witnesses 2/2.
- The diagonal profile is the declared reproducible baseline by A06; an official joint likelihood remains externally unavailable.
- CKM is closed at the selected prediction-with-uncertainty standard by A14; exact equality to a moving central estimator is not an additional physical theorem obligation.
- The retarded representative q=79/F/m1 is selected inside its antiunitary orbit by A17; global carrier-measure uniqueness remains open.
- A20 proves the neutral minimal-trace boundary formula conditionally fixes m_lightest=0; A21 contracts its three source clauses to one selected complex-symmetric neutral mass operator, A23 advances its source-provenance inventory to 4/8 fields, A24 proves the remaining dimensionful-block normal form with three lawful exits while keeping value rows open, A25 executes the overlap/physical/action gate at 3/9 OK gates and 0/3 accepted exits, A26 promotes neutral projector/Gram readiness to 5/9 OK gates and 6/12 subfields, and A27 closes only the typed L x N^c x H_u structural Gamma_nu carrier with nine 3x3 slots and 7/13 readiness.
- A38-A40 complete the neutral two-primitive profile-value route: the common-circle cosine orbit reduces shape to phi_nu, finite rho_E is proved determinant-trivial, and two explicitly declared measured oscillation primitives fill all 36 neutral numerical rows.
- A41 proves the exact Lens/Dedekind mixed reciprocity residue 1/240 for the selected retarded pair 16->15. Conditional APS determinant-line identification gives phi_nu=pi/120 and reduces the neutral splitting profile to one scale input, but the operator/counterterm normalization is open and the target-ranked hypothesis is not yet a prediction.
- A42 gives a sharply typed conditional absolute-scale candidate: one shared measured E0 fixed through G and the M-theory 11D lift reproduce the A40 neutral amplitude at about 18 ppm. Native MTT is 10D, and the physical neutral-operator lift identification and source law remain open.
- A43 conditionally compresses the lifted attenuation to the composite eigenvalue 661/4 and proves the A41 profile denominator is a unit-trace normalization. Native 10D misses by 448^2 in A_nu; lift selection, cost replication, nil saturation and the same-operator Z64/nil bridge remain open.
- A44 locks the embedded local-QFT recovery as already closed and proves an exact conditional same-geometry finite-algebra bridge from the three qutrit class lanes to C plus H plus M3(C). Physical projector/lane and weak real-structure selection, representation emission and anomaly execution remain open.
- A45 closes the native rank flag and weak symplectic real structure up to gauge equivalence, but proves that A44's class-lane assignment is physically mistyped: the class lane is family/character data. Preserve the family factor and construct a separate `A_F` representation acting identically on every family.
- A46 consumes the earlier SM-slot functor, q79 E6 branching dictionary and A45 family/gauge typing to close the explicit 48-state family-diagonal chiral representation and its complete anomaly table. Treat E6 and the three 27s as selected-bundle outputs and the decomposition as exact; do not claim the physical low-energy breaking route or unimodularity is uniquely selected until its holonomy/Wilson/operator theorem is supplied.
- A47 supersedes that last low-energy breaking guard through the direct native-bundle route: `U1 x SU2 x SU3` and its faithful `/Z6` global form are selected without an E6 Wilson line. E6 remains a UV encoding rather than the required low-energy breaking mechanism. Keep gauge-coupling values, strict metrology and the optional full Connes bimodule separate.
- A48 supplies the previously imported-but-unexecuted finite NCG layer: a 96-dimensional real-even bimodule with exact order-zero and structural order-one checks. Do not promote its unit channel incidences to physical Yukawa magnitudes or claim orientability/Poincare duality before their explicit certificates exist.
- A49 supersedes A48's three open finite-triple fields. The profile `D_F` is now explicit and verified, but the native three-summand KO6 geometry has a proved orientability/Poincare-duality no-go. Use the four-summand `C_N` result only as the exact minimal completion candidate until MTT selects that neutral summand and controls its extra unitary direction; do not call the native A48 triple a full Connes triple.
- A50 selects the A49 completion from the existing complex `1_M=N^c` carrier and proves that anomaly freedom locks `C` and `C_N` to the unique shared hypercharge circle. The completed four-summand finite triple is closed at profile tier; retain the distinction from strict no-knob values and from optional ultraviolet anomalous-U1 cancellation mechanisms.
- A51 corrects the corpus claim that inner fluctuations automatically yield one Higgs: the unrestricted completed triple has three doublet modules. The selected MTT alignment projection reduces them exactly to one Higgs doublet. Use the generated gauge/Yukawa trace coefficients, but do not claim absolute spectral-action normalization until the cutoff moments and four-dimensional product geometry are selected.
- A52 closes the product-triple/profile matter normalization and proves that one universal spectral moment cannot reproduce the accepted pure-SM running couplings. Use the explicit profile overlap metric only as measured-profile normalization. Do not revive the invalid 5 TeV cutoff or call the proper-time moments source-derived until the successor source theorem exists.
- A53 proves proper-time moments and relative gauge overlaps are independent source problems. Retain its point measure only conditionally, reject the rank-metric near-hit, and target the two literal-HYM overlap ratios rather than further cutoff-function fitting.
- A106-A132 replace the former free `8+64` gerbe-row picture by an exact
  integral-period system, retire the invalid single-branch `tau=i` shortcut,
  expose the actual K3 selector as a 36-real Schur complement coupled to the
  16-real gerbe equations, provide one exact smooth rational marked-K3 and
  spectral-surface test carrier, construct the torsor/Poincare Cech formula,
  reduce its analytic periods to an exact 90-node genus-two Lefschetz fibration
  with an explicit rank-four normal-function source, certify every critical
  value and nodal lift, and certify all 92 local-plus-handle path carriers.
  A114-A116 promote the two handle actions and all 90 local and distinguished
  Picard-Lefschetz factors and close `M_90...M_1=B^-1 A^-1 B A` exactly.
  A117-A119 emit the selected-lift coupled quotient, exact rank-92 integral
  basis and floating `8x92` period table. A120-A122 close the exact
  normal-function source, complete integral affine cocycle, normalized Deligne
  transgression and aligned `q_A` source correction. A123 proves exact
  two-chart covariance and retires the first apparent wall as a coordinate
  artifact. A124 proves the exact transported local jump formula and verifies
  its floating unit-jump execution. A125 supplies the Arb/ACB Krawczyk
  enclosure of the genuine wall, proves its unique transverse simple node and
  nonzero transported Picard-Lefschetz jump, and certifies the finite
  selected-side Abel-Jacobi base lift. A126 certifies the finite-flat local
  contour homotopy through one symmetric `Q2` root exchange and validates the
  endpoint bound `||beta(1)||_2>2.2500100575`, excluding the frozen selected
  `ell=0` branch. A127 proves the same-carrier/basis-invariance cutset, tightens
  that beta enclosure, and rebuilds the selected endpoint geometry through 90
  simple critical values, a certified 90-meridian fan and 90 pointwise
  Picard-Lefschetz transvections. A128 promotes all 90 local actions using
  continuous interval root tubes and independently certified braid replay.
  A129 certifies both selected handle actions and closes the exact global
  punctured-torus relation. A130 derives the central lifts from certified
  leading-coefficient windings and emits a primitive rank-92 integral `H2`
  basis. A131 executes all 90 selected thimbles and both selected handle lifts,
  synchronizes their orientations without fitting period values, and assembles
  the full floating `8x92` table on that exact basis, with 16 exact Leray-zero
  entries. A132 factors out the primitive Leray-null pair exactly, reducing the
  effective branch domain to `Z^90`, and supplies a deterministic height-four
  continuation seed inside the present beta enclosure without promoting it to
  exact equality. Interval nonzero-period certification, exact effective-branch
  selection and gerbe zero/no-go remain open.
  The older Strominger fixed-point result must be cited only as a conditional
  fixed-sector field block after its OU, fiber-gap, Hessian and FP-to-field-map
  repairs; neither it nor the constructive witnesses selects the marked K3.
- A22 computes the exact E6 Qpsi color anomaly: +12 matter and -12 complete-27 exotics cancel. The naive matter-only/singlet value N_DW=3 is diagnostic only, and the selected flux/threshold anomaly-matching map remains open.

### Still open

- zero-primitive/no-knob empirical derivation
- global carrier-measure uniqueness beyond the selected retarded orientation representative
- rank-three HYM sector transfer and uniqueness over all HYM branches beyond the closed selected rank-two witness
- strict no-knob neutral source selection: A41 supplies the exact 1/240 phase candidate, while A42-A43 supply a conditional 11D-lift E0 candidate at 18 ppm and composite 661/4 reduction; native MTT is 10D and fails this scale, so MTT must first select the physical neutral operator on the lift, then prove APS normalization, nil saturation, cost replication and the common-circle/nil same-operator bridge; ontology/order selection and covariance also remain open
- same-geometry generative SM base: A53-A69 construct the gauge spectral/positive-density spine and reduce it to two source costs. A70 is a frozen but ill-typed sub-ppm numerical conjecture; A71 computes the actual 16-mode `L64` spectrum and blocks its strict promotion. A72 then supplies the properly typed replacement `F(L64,Delta79)` from normalized Green and nontrivial `Z7`/Lens projector traces, uniquely best in the declared canonical grid and within `1.2` ppm with zero continuous parameters. A73 proves that functional is exactly the response of one finite normalized determinant action and freezes it by hash. A74 proves the normalized trace and projector fractions are forced finite-algebra data and records a commensurate legacy covariance test (`p=0.15685`) of the frozen ratios. A75 derives the finite Gaussian `log det` shape, corrects its direct-sum normalization to a center-valued response, and proves the rank-two finite-counterterm obstruction. A76 constructs the `112/96` and `64/48` tower-augmentation domains and rejects the tempting but non-equivariant `96/48` matter-carrier identification. A77 derives the exact 4D BRST determinant weight and primitive-character `P7/P4` routing and replays A73. A78 closes the center-to-sector kinetic functor and relative one-primitive boundary while exposing one binary lepton sign. A79 proves an ungraded positive-response no-go and constructs the corresponding relative grading. A80 proves that the sign is a quotient coordinate, replaces it by the canonical positive projector-complement Hessian, and retires the binary sign parameter. A81 proves the physical quarter-character anchor is unitarily equivalent to the rank-three projective tangent complement and that the unique unital anchor-to-sector map emits `I-P_e`; it also closes six known spectator classes. A82 composes the later closed `Z7` certificate with the selected family `Z3` inside the ambient `Z1344` shared-circle carrier, derives the unique `Z21` regular-trace multiplicities, and constructs an exact zero-parameter parent functional emitting baseline costs `3` and `14/3`; it also exhausts diagonal spectators within the declared three-block sector partition. A83 executes its canonical heat density and gauge covariantization, reproducing all A80 kinetic rows exactly, and isolates a two-clause action premise. A84 derives its heat-shadow clause from fixed-point damping and the regime-local ten-dimensional action. A85 closes bare finite matching at the corpus spectral-action tier and separates the renormalized scheme, which is already fixed at the current profile standard. A86 then consumes the later closed Route-A `I+Z/I+X` source theorem to promote the formerly conditional `Phi_C1^+` density and all three finite gauge-action rows. A87 closes the convention-safe `g_i^-2=cK_i` map, explicitly separates `P_EW` from `c=6f0`, and reduces the three common-scheme gauge coordinates to one common `g2` normalization anchor plus two frozen geometric ratios. The active frontier is no longer CSGA2, A67, or the action-to-coupling convention. It is a genuinely prospective two-ratio validation or a primitive source theorem for the one remaining common kinetic normalization `c`; deriving the spectral-action proper-time premise and renormalized condition from primitive MTT remains the broader no-assumption program. There is no remaining relative-gauge numerical object, matrix-entry, multiplicity, sign, projector, density-source, finite-action-completeness, or convention search. Wick/gravity provenance remains foundational rather than a matter-profile blocker
- finish the A103-A132 q79 compactification promotion: the rank-one
  shared-circle topology, smooth non-pullback `SU3` bundles with `c3=+/-6`,
  full hidden `SU9` holonomy, finite hidden `Z3` commutant, determinant-zero
  spectral cover, exact spectral-surface topology, integral
  `DD(alpha)|C=0`, trace/Prym `1+8` reduction, splitting-conic K3 normal form,
  integral relative-period equations and covariant gerbe Jacobian are closed.
  A109-A132 now supply one exact smooth rational marked model, smooth spectral
  surface, explicit `O(delta)` transitions, Fu-Yau torsor, normalized Poincare
  cocycle, exact 90-node genus-two Lefschetz reduction, certified local and
  handle monodromy, an exact rank-92 integral cycle basis, a floating-converged
  `8x92` period table, the exact affine normal-function cocycle, normalized
  Deligne beta representative, aligned-divisor source, projective chart
  covariance, exact transported local Picard-Lefschetz formula, interval-
  certified unique transverse wall and nonzero PL jump, and an interval-
  certified finite selected-side Abel-Jacobi base lift, finite-flat local
  contour homotopy, and validated nonzero selected-side endpoint beta. The active selector is
  no longer 72 free gerbe entries, an unspecified good-cover integral, an
  unspecified normal-function source, or eight independently supplied beta
  rows. It is exact effective `Z^90` membership together with a same-carrier PGL3
  zero/no-go. The first apparent `ell=0` wall is a chart artifact; the later
  genuine wall is rigorous, its two one-sided beta limits cannot both vanish,
  A126 excludes the frozen selected-side `ell=0` endpoint, and A127 retires
  cross-carrier A119 reuse while constructing the selected endpoint 90-node
  period-execution input through pointwise monodromy. A128-A130 certify those
  root tubes, both handle transports, the exact global relation, the selected
  central lifts and a complete primitive endpoint integral basis. A131 then
  executes the selected-carrier `8x92` period table with an independent tighter
  rerun and exact Leray-zero block. A132 quotients that exact Leray-null pair and
  emits a height-four continuation seed. Only after exact effective `Z^90` branch selection and
  a stationary selected point or
  a clearly labeled existence witness with exact integral-period zero and
  nonzero Jacobian may the inverse Fourier-Mukai bundle, balanced HYM and
  differential Bianchi identity be executed. Full holonomy removes hidden
  condensation but does not make one-loop thresholds vacuous: they may still
  depend on the 38 complex hidden-bundle moduli. The seven selected NS5 values
  must also be inserted into A101's exact A98 envelopes
- MTT derivation of quantization/Born/record rules
- constructive nonperturbative four-dimensional QFT

### Clause-by-clause applicability

| Report scope | Verdict | Relation to current theorems and revision action |
|---|---|---|
| Parts I-II: status vocabulary and dependency order | **APPLIES** | Use unchanged. New successors alter downstream status, not the distinction among theorem, embedding, calibration, replay and prediction. |
| Part III.1-3: 4+6 geometry, symbols, time/scale | **APPLIES** | No numerical successor proves a different coordinate decomposition. The central circle remains bundle/phase data rather than an extra seventh fiber coordinate. |
| Part III.4-9: commutation, gaps, signs, fixed points, locality and maps | **APPLIES** | These are mathematical typing and hypothesis corrections upstream of all calculation repositories. |
| Part III.10-12: probability, reduced density dynamics, signature | **APPLIES** | A03 imports standard SM quantization but does not derive the missing MTT basin-trace/Born or signature-selection theorems. |
| Part III.13 and P0.4-P0.5: external Gaussian QG and all-loop finiteness | **APPLIES** | A03 is perturbative SM observable equivalence, not a constructive QG or all-loop finiteness theorem. |
| P0.1: right-inverse obstruction | **APPLIES** | No later repository restores the invalid inference from noninjectivity to absence of a right inverse. |
| P0.2: 4.2-5 TeV execution chain | **APPLIES WITH REPLACEMENT** | Withdraw the old crossing and dependent calibrations. A02 replaces precision running/matching at Q=Mt; it does not validate the old scale. |
| P0.3: explicit Iwasawa bundle | **APPLIES WITH SELECTED SUCCESSOR** | The old nonclosed Chern representative remains invalid. A07 closes the finite literal Cech witness, A15 closes Chern patching, and A19 closes continuum existence/local uniqueness for the selected rank-two q79/F/m1 HYM witness. This does not rehabilitate the withdrawn old representative or prove rank-three/global-branch uniqueness. |
| P0.6 and Groups 3-4: Foundation/Fixed-Points corrections | **APPLIES** | The calculation repositories consume portions of this spine but do not repair the source papers automatically. |
| Groups 6-9: QM, probability, measurement and Bell | **APPLIES WITH AUDITED PARTIAL RESULTS** | A18 preserves six conditional quantization results, but A03/A18 do not prove the MTT basin-trace equality, capture measure, outcome rule or global selection measure. |
| Group 7: QFT and amplitudes | **APPLIES WITH SUCCESSOR** | A03 closes the standard perturbative observable functor on the embedded SM branch. Rewrite derivation claims so BRST/Faddeev-Popov, Green functions and LSZ are explicitly imported parity structure. |
| Groups 10 and 13: proto-spinor/topology/SM | **APPLIES WITH SUCCESSOR** | Uniqueness and representation-input cautions remain. A01-A04 add a scoped numerical parity/profile theorem, not a unique no-knob derivation of particles. A11 fixes q=79 on its exact branch. |
| Group 11 and proto-spinor GR response | **APPLIES WITH SCOPED A13** | A13 closes internal exact-branch TT support, not Newton/Planck normalization, full stress response or projection-only derivation of Einstein gravity. |
| Group 12: quantum gravity | **APPLIES WITH AUDITED PARTIAL RESULTS** | A18 records finite-domain constructive results but neither the SM observable functor, multi-loop SMDR transport nor A13/A18 closes full continuum QG, positivity or asymptotic completeness. |
| Group 16: string/flux | **APPLIES WITH A07/A15/A19/A101-A132** | Keep embedding/reconstruction language and the Iwasawa withdrawal; add the verified finite Cech result, Chern patching, selected rank-two continuum HYM theorem, and q79 compactification reductions. A108 requires the Strominger selection paper to remain a conditional fixed-sector correspondence until its OU, gap, Hessian and FP-to-field map are repaired. A109-A132 supply exact marked/spectral/Cech/Lefschetz/isolation/path data, promoted identity-carrier local/handle/distinguished monodromies, the exact global integral `H_1` relation, selected-lift rank-92 surface-cycle basis, floating-converged identity `8x92` period table, exact affine normal-function cocycle, normalized Deligne beta representative, aligned-divisor source correction, exact chart covariance, exact local PL formula, interval-certified unique transverse wall and nonzero transported jump, interval-certified finite selected-side Abel-Jacobi base lift, finite-flat local contour homotopy, a validated selected-side endpoint beta excluding the frozen `ell=0` branch, and the selected-alignment 90-node cut system, continuous root tubes, local and handle actions, global relation, selected central lifts, complete primitive rank-92 integral basis, full floating selected-carrier `8x92` period table, exact Leray-null quotient and height-four continuation seed. Do not reuse the identity period table across carriers. Interval nonzero-period certification, exact effective `Z^90` branch selection, K3-period selection and gerbe zero remain open. |
| Group 18: Theta and execution | **PARTLY SUPERSEDED** | The old numerical tables remain invalid where tied to 5 TeV or fitted matrices. Replace matching observables with A01-A06 and preserve replay/profile labels. |
| Part XII: final status | **APPLIES WITH ONE ADDITION** | Its unique/no-knob/foundational open list remains correct. Add the newly closed embedded renormalized-SM equivalence result at the declared profile standard. |

## Mandatory paper language

Use this exact headline for the current numerical result:

> MTT closes embedded renormalized-Standard-Model equivalence at the adopted one-shared-physical-primitive/profile standard on the selected branch.

Always append this limitation in the same abstract or conclusion:

> This is an embedding/parity result with measured profile inputs and imported standard SM quantization. It is not zero-knob derivation, unique observed-branch selection, or a derivation of perturbative quantization from MTT.

For the old numerical execution chain, state:

> The former 4.2-5 TeV crossing and dependent threshold calibration are withdrawn. The replacement precision calculation uses the selected SMDR multi-loop transport at Q=Mt with an explicit diagonal measured-input profile.

For the neutral numerical profile, state:

> All 36 neutral numerical rows are filled from two explicitly declared measured mass-squared splittings at the normal-ordering Dirac profile with m_lightest=0. This is profile execution, not a strict MTT source derivation of the two primitive values, ontology, ordering or covariance.

For flux/Iwasawa papers, state:

> The former nonclosed Iwasawa Chern representative is not used. A finite literal Cech witness, Chern patching, and a selected rank-two continuum HYM representative are now verified by independent successor theorems. Rank-three sector transfer and uniqueness over all HYM branches remain open.

## Revision order

1. Patch the Foundation and Fixed-Points spine using the durable corrigendum blocks.
2. Patch map typing, locality, probability and QFT/QG scope before importing numerical successors.
3. Rebuild the dedicated MTT-to-SM paper, Execution I/II, the tiered roadmap and all Theta-Closure papers around A01-A07 and A14-A87.
4. Patch proto-spinor and topology papers so structural encodings are separated from selected numerical outputs.
5. Patch strings/flux papers with the Iwasawa withdrawal plus the A07 finite-Cech, A15 Chern-patching, and A19 selected continuum HYM successors.
6. Update the book and index last so they summarize only revised papers.

- **Required changes:**
  - State explicitly that MTT is not Bell-local in the conditional-factorization sense.
  - The consistent package is upper-local dynamics + microcausality + no-signaling + globally nonfactorizing states.
  - If \(\xi\) is called complete, explain how the setting-dependent global fixed point is determined: global boundary value, retrocausality, incompleteness, or nonseparable ontology.
  - Do not call the construction a classical local hidden-variable completion.

- **Required changes:**
  - Separate physical measurement times from stabilization time.
  - Attribute Leggett–Garg violation to invasiveness/context dependence and global history constraints, not projection alone.
  - State the measurement instruments and update rules explicitly.

## Validation before editing is declared complete

- Every revised paper must have a new version filename and an explicit supersedes note.
- Every numerical table must cite a packet/certificate and state whether it is source-derived, profile/replay, calibration or held-out prediction.
- No historical `open` packet may override A01-A07 or A14-A87; no successor may erase its own scope guard.
- Run the relevant repository verifier and a corpus-wide search for the corrigendum patterns after each revision group.
- Update the book and index only after all paper revisions pass their checks.
