# q79 Fu-Yau Mixed C2 Hodge Admissibility Theorem v1

## Exact statement

Let the selected rank-one Fu-Yau space be the principal two-torus bundle over
the degree-two K3 with curvature pair `(delta,0)`, where

```text
delta=H-L,   delta^2=-4,   H.delta=0.
```

Write `eta_delta` for the nontrivial circle connection and `eta_shared` for
the closed shared-circle form.  The selected complex vertical form is

```text
Theta=eta_delta+i eta_shared.
```

Since `H` and `delta` are integral `(1,1)` classes and `delta` is primitive
for the `H`-polarized K3 metric, `delta wedge H=0`.  Therefore

```text
Hhat = eta_delta wedge pi^*H,
u    = eta_delta wedge eta_shared wedge pi^*H
     = (i/2) Theta wedge conjugate(Theta) wedge pi^*H
```

are closed.  Fiber integration gives `pi_!(Hhat)=H`, so this `u` is the same
primitive mixed class selected by the Gysin/clutching theorem.  It is of type
`(2,2)`.  The orientation class is represented by the vertical area wedged
with the K3 volume and is of type `(3,3)`.

It follows that the simultaneous smooth target

```text
c1=0,   c2=9u,   c3=+/-6[X]^*
```

passes the necessary Hodge-type test on the selected Fu-Yau complex
structure.  No continuous parameter is added.

## What this closes

The new smooth bundle is not excluded from holomorphic promotion merely
because its second Chern class lies in the mixed shared-circle channel.  The
mixed class has an explicit closed `(2,2)` representative, and the chirality
class has type `(3,3)`.

## What remains open

An integral class of the correct type is not automatically the Chern class of
a holomorphic vector bundle on a non-Kahler threefold.  This theorem does not
construct the inverse-gerbe spectral sheaf, prove WIT or local freeness,
establish determinant zero, prove balanced stability/HYM, or solve the
differential Bianchi identity.  Those are the next gates; UV completion is
not claimed.
