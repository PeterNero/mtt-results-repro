  We reduce one open part of the anchored kinetic metric candidate.  The
  apparent choice of family order is not an arbitrary flavor knob if the three
  Z3 family labels are identified with the proto-spinor closure roles already
  present in the corpus: transport/unanchored, lens/interface, and
  nil/termination.  The lens/nil gap hierarchy orders their normalized anchor
  costs as J_transport=0 < J_lens=lambda_nil/lambda_lens < J_nil=1.  The
  remaining freedom is only a simultaneous relabeling of the family basis,
  which is a convention unless other sector data break it.  The sector scale
  and exact metric extraction remain open.

  Proto-Spinor Anchor-Ordering Lemma for the Family Metric

# Purpose

The anchored metric candidate used:

```text
J = (0, lambda_nil/lambda_lens, 1).
```

The remaining concern is whether assigning these three costs to the three
family labels is an arbitrary choice.

This note separates convention from content.

# Role Triple

The corpus/book-aligned proto-spinor language distinguishes three closure
roles:

```text
transport / unanchored continuation,
lens / interface or partial anchoring,
nil / termination and survivor anchoring.
```

The theta-closure corpus gives a gap hierarchy:

```text
lambda_lens > lambda_nil.
```

In normalized anchor-cost units this induces:

```text
J_transport = 0,
J_lens      = lambda_nil/lambda_lens,
J_nil       = 1.
```

Thus:

```text
0 < J_lens < J_nil.
```

# Lemma: Anchor Ordering Is Canonical Up to Relabeling

Assume the retained `Z3` family carrier is identified with the three
proto-spinor closure roles:

```text
transport, lens, nil.
```

Then the anchor-cost ordering:

```text
transport < lens < nil
```

is fixed by role and gap hierarchy, not by observed flavor data.  Any
permutation of the labels `f=0,1,2` is only a basis relabeling unless additional
sector data distinguish the family vertices.

Proof.  Transport has no anchoring cost by definition of the role.  Nil is the
termination/survivor anchoring role and sets the normalized anchor scale.  Lens
is an interface/partial anchoring role whose stiffness is controlled by the
larger lens gap, giving the intermediate normalized cost
`lambda_nil/lambda_lens`.  The strict inequality follows from
`lambda_lens > lambda_nil > 0`.  Relabeling `Z3` changes names of basis vectors
but not the ordered role triple.

# What This Closes

```text
anchor role ordering transport < lens < nil       PROVED-SCHEMA
family label order is convention up to relabeling PROVED
no measured flavor data used in ordering          CHECKED
```

# What Remains

```text
derive sector scale s_x                            OPEN
derive exact kinetic metric from L_loc,x           OPEN
determine whether Q,u,d use same role basis        OPEN
compute normalized CKM                             OPEN
```

# Bottom Line

The anchored metric is no longer an arbitrary diagonal triple.  Its ordered
shape is fixed once the `Z3` family labels are read as:

```text
transport, lens, nil.
```

The hard remaining step is extracting the sector scale and exact metric from
the selected localization operator.
