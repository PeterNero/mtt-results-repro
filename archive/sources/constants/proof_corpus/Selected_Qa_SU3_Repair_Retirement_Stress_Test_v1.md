# Selected Qa/SU3 Repair Retirement Stress Test v1

## Purpose

This stress-tests the retirement of Repair A.

The conclusion is deliberately conditional:

```text
Repair A is retired under the currently selected indecomposable/stable rank-3
SU(3) HYM branch.
```

It is not claimed to be an impossible mathematical object in every possible
branch.

## External Research Check

The external HYM literature supports the guardrail:

```text
Hitchin-Kobayashi / Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau:
HYM corresponds to polystability; stable branches have only scalar automorphisms.
```

Modern heterotic SU(3) / Strominger-system literature also supports the caution
that torsion and instanton choices can matter, but they must be part of the
selected system and cannot be inserted as target-fitting corrections.

## Algebraic Signatures

Repair A:

```text
B1 = E13,
B2 = -E31,
B3 = E11 - E33.
```

It has an extra noncentral unitary stabilizer:

```text
i diag(-1, 2, -1) / sqrt(6).
```

It also has an invariant direct coordinate splitting:

```text
<e2> plus <e1,e3>.
```

So Repair A is compatible with a reducible or polystable block branch, but not
with the selected indecomposable rank-3 SU(3) HYM branch unless the corpus is
changed.

Repair B:

```text
B1 = E13,
B2 = -E32,
B3 = E12.
```

Repair B does have invariant coordinate flags.  That nuance matters.  The
stronger and relevant fact is:

```text
Repair B has no extra unitary centralizer and no invariant direct-sum coordinate
split in this diagnostic.
```

That is compatible with an indecomposable extension picture, even though Repair
B still fails the primitive/HYM contraction until a sourced correction is found.

## Revival Options For Repair A

Repair A can be revived only by one of the following moves:

```text
1. Change the selected branch to a polystable SU(2)+line or block SU(2) color
   branch.

2. Prove a new source theorem that the noncentral stabilizer is a legitimate
   quotient gauge mode.

3. Source-certify a full torsion/OU/operator term that lifts the extra Cartan
   zero without target fitting.
```

All three are real options to explore, but all three change the current proof
obligations.

## Conclusion

The retirement is upheld in the precise sense:

```text
Repair A is not the selected indecomposable rank-3 SU(3) HYM branch.
```

The stronger false statement:

```text
Repair A is mathematically impossible.
```

is not claimed.

The live branch remains:

```text
Repair B, plus a source-certified primitive correction or a no-go theorem.
```

## Verdict

```text
Repair A retired under current selection: yes
Repair A forbidden as any math object: no
Repair B closed: no
safe to close Qa/SU3: no
target fitting used: no
```
