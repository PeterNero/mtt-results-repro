# PostAlpha Hybrid SameSource NoGo v1

## Result

Alpha1 and honest dotD replay remain closed locally. The post-alpha blocker is
the same-source operator/overlap packet:

```text
required fields = 7
selected emitted = 0
support present = 6
current-source no-go = true
mathematical impossibility = false
```

The minimal dependency order is now:

```text
S1 source_identity_bridge
S2 operator_values_payload
S3 matter_overlap_payload
S4 primitive_contractions_payload
```

Status:

```text
POST_ALPHA_HYBRID_SAMESOURCE_NOGO_REDUCED_SOURCE_IDENTITY_BRIDGE_OPEN
```

Next:

```text
Selected_U1Y_RouteC_OperatorSourceIdentity_Bridge_Subpacket_v1
```
