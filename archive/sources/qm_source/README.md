# MTT Finite Quantum Source Proof

This repository isolates the quantum-model and basin-to-Born problem from the
active eta9, Standard-Model, and q79 Groebner calculations. Those repositories
are read-only inputs here.

The program has ten sharply separated result tiers:

1. an exact finite-symbol quantum-kinematics package on the selected q79
   two-copy `S3` carrier;
2. an exact canonical binary one-anchor Cauchy/Fock operational model whose
   commuting output algebra gives a classical first-record measure and
   `SecondMomentCaptureDescent`; and
3. a selected-branch framed free massless Dirac/CAR local observable net with
   time-slice, Hadamard state-space and exact q79 `P/Q` continuum components;
4. a typed q79-continuum three-family Standard-Model gauge, matter and
   one-Higgs field stack with exact Yukawa covariance, nonlinear BRST and a
   classical shifted-cotangent BV master action; and
5. an A57-compatible background-gauge hyperbolic free BV complex with
   advanced/retarded propagators, equicausal Peierls/star algebra, time-slice
   and free BRST cohomology on declared q79 background charts; and
6. a formal renormalized Epstein-Glaser interacting BV algebra with exact
   zero local gauge-anomaly class, an all-orders perturbative QME scheme and
   zero faithful-`Z6` spin global-anomaly obstruction; and
7. a local formal physical-state tier: exact BRST quartet positivity and
   deformation-stable interacting pre-Hilbert representations on bounded
   `H1=0` q79 regions, together with a contravariant state-space functor and
   exact common-parent finite compatibility, plus formal state-cone transport
   under Hadamard, renormalization and gauge presentation changes; and
8. a literal free physical q79 SM C*-reference net at `lambda=0`, with GNS
   and local von Neumann representations, locally quasiequivalent declared
   Hadamard folia, and an exact no-go against unique fixed-nonzero-coupling
   promotion from the formal jet alone; and
9. an actual compact-gauge Cstar landing at every finite auxiliary regulator
   and declared nonzero coupling, plus an exact normalized
   relative-S source/cocycle-generator first-tangent bridge to the formal
   Lorentzian EG/SP jet, together with an exact orbitwise finite-spectral
   chiral Berezin measure and unit gauge Jacobian on each certified connected
   gapped presentation component, plus an exact dependency theorem showing
   that the missing smooth physical operator family is canonically completed
   after its HYM/action source exists but cannot be selected from the current
   finite projected rows, together with an exact curved projective-module
   representation theorem, external `1<2<3` lane placement and
   invariant-subspace/Feshbach criterion for its future finite reduction,
   plus an explicit Cech projector and connection-correction compiler whose
   hidden adjoint descent and rank-102 block transport require no
   post-endpoint symbol selector, and an intrinsic relative-phase quotient
   theorem which excludes a direct linear rank-six root-stack subspace and
   replaces it by the basis-free reduced-Green shorted Hessian, with physical
   TT matching reduced to a same-source `S3 x C4` symmetry lift whose exact
   quarter-turn forces the Reynolds shape without independent matrix values;
   and
10. conditional/no-go theorems stating what remains for general apparatus
   contexts, pre-quantum probability semantics and objective actualization.

It does **not** claim a strict zero-anchor clock, arbitrary apparatus source
maps, a pre-quantum derivation of state-expectation probability, a uniquely
actual ontic history, a preferred state, a selected interacting state on the
full noncompact q79 branch, arbitrary state-sheaf gluing, an interacting
Hilbert completion at fixed nonzero couplings, selected numerical
RG/matching, convergence, or a
nonperturbative Standard Model.

## Verify

```powershell
python scripts\verify.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

After an upstream paper or certificate hash changes, rebuild the
source-sensitive QFT chain in dependency order before running the full
verifier:

```powershell
python scripts\rebuild_qft_provenance_chain.py
```

This writes and validates each producer before evaluating its consumers, so
one-pass provenance lag cannot create a false cascade of failed certificates.

The verifier checks source hashes, reconstructs the Reynolds projector and
normalized Hessian exactly over the rationals, checks the two exact complex
structures, and emits:

## Status Boundary

The finite carrier, Cauchy Hilbert system, state cone, observable algebra,
one-anchor reduced dynamics and canonical `P/Q` preparation/apparatus functor
are exact on the declared finite-symbol domain. `B.QM.02` is complete at that
tier.

The new Fock-output theorem proves the canonical `P/Q` first-record law and
`SecondMomentCaptureDescent` by restricting the selected normal state to the
commuting output-counting algebra. Thus `B.QM.01` is complete at the canonical
binary operational-output tier. This result inherits standard normal-state
probability semantics; it does not derive those semantics from pre-quantum
basins or select one ontically actual path.

General context-indexed basin maps and apparatus interaction sources remain
open. The one-axiom `A_Born` and one-primitive marked-Poisson packets remain
explicit stronger fallbacks outside the newly closed canonical operational
domain.

On the selected q79 Lorentzian branch, the global coframe and parallel
rank-six carrier now also define the zero-order-free twisted massless Dirac
operator. Its CAR functor has graded locality and time-slice; the even subnet
is Einstein local and functorially unique on the chosen spin category. The
locally compatible Hadamard state space is nonempty, but no preferred vacuum
is selected. Thus `B.QFT.01` is complete at the selected framed free-Dirac
even-observable-net tier.

The A45-A51 finite SM packet now also composes with that selected q79 spin
spacetime. The resulting rank-48 three-family chiral bundle and one Higgs
doublet have exact faithful-quotient descent, anomaly cancellation and four
gauge-invariant Yukawa channels. The nonlinear BRST differential extends to
the Higgs sector, and the canonical shifted-cotangent action satisfies the
classical BV master equation. `B.QFT.02` therefore no longer begins at carrier
construction or classical BRST.

On every declared on-shell background chart, A57's fluctuation slots now
compose with the q79 Lorentzian principal symbol in background
Feynman-'t Hooft gauge. The gauge, ghost and Higgs blocks are normally
hyperbolic, the fermion block is Dirac type, and the antighost/auxiliary pair
is contractible. Their Green operators define the equicausal Peierls and free
Hadamard-star algebra, with free physical observables given by ghost-number
zero BRST cohomology. The earlier unrestricted-microcausal closure and
time-slice wording is superseded: modern counterexamples apply even to fixed
linear Green-hyperbolic operators, while the equicausal subcomplex restores
Peierls/star closure and the time-slice homotopy.

Renormalized Epstein-Glaser products now extend this free algebra to the
formal interacting Bogoliubov algebra. The exact three-family chiral rows give
the complete power-counting local anomaly vector `(0,0,0,0,0)`. Local BRST
cohomology and Adler-Bardeen then provide a formal all-orders QME scheme, a
nilpotent interacting quantum-BV differential and gauge-fixing-independent
ghost-number-zero cohomology. For the faithful `/Z6` group,
`Omega_5^Spin(BG)=0`, so the residual spin global gauge-anomaly obstruction
also vanishes.

On bounded causally complete q79 regions with compact closure and `H1=0`, the
free gauge/ghost modes now have an exact graded BRST quartet. At ghost number
zero its closed-space Gram matrix is `diag(1,1,0)`, with the null direction
exact, so the physical quotient has Gram matrix `I2`. Tensoring positive
Higgs and Weyl Hadamard factors gives a positive free physical state. The
anomaly-free Ward/QME scheme supplies a hermitian nilpotent interacting
charge, and BRST deformation stability gives a nonempty family of formal
positive states and formal pre-Hilbert representations.

These local physical state spaces now form a nonempty contravariant functor
under admissible q79-chart embeddings. Any finite collection of regions with
one admissible common parent has an exactly compatible family obtained by
restricting one parent state. An exact Bell-marginal witness also proves that
arbitrary independently chosen overlap-agreeing states need not glue, so the
correct closed object is a state-space functor rather than a sheaf of states.

Compatible Hadamard covariances are now related by an exact normal-ordering
cocycle. Admissible time-ordering prescriptions are related by
Stueckelberg-Petermann maps, and admissible gauge-fixing changes induce formal
BV cohomology isomorphisms. These arrows transport normalized formal positive
physical states and commute with local restriction. Thus the formal physical
algebra/state-cone functor is presentation-independent up to the specified
formal isomorphisms.

At the exact free interaction coordinate `lambda=0`, the positive physical
gauge Weyl algebra, four-component Higgs Weyl algebra and selected chiral CAR
algebra now form a minimal-tensor-product C*-field net. Its compact
gauge/even fixed points give the physical observable net. Scalar and chiral
Hadamard local quasiequivalence, together with one constraint-preserving
implementable gauge Hadamard orbit, provide literal GNS, local von Neumann
and normal-folium comparison at this free tier.

The interacting theory remains formal. An exact flat-function construction
now proves that identical all-orders perturbative jets can have different
fixed-coupling Hamiltonian dynamics and states. Therefore formal coefficients
alone cannot select a unique interacting C*-completion. The remaining
`B.QFT.02` regulator route is now sharper. If MTT selects one positive
self-adjoint compact-resolvent external BV Hodge Laplacian and
BRST-compatible domain, its spectral projectors automatically give a nested
finite chain-map family and an exact high-mode contracting homotopy. The
one-mode q79 quartet realizes this mechanism exactly.

An exact tensor-rank theorem also excludes the selected finite HYM projector,
finite SM Dirac operator, A57 internal spectra and finite MLD QME seed from
being relabeled as that spacetime regulator. They do not cut external modes.

One concrete external operator/domain package now exists on a rounded compact
q79 chart. The coframe supplies an explicitly auxiliary positive metric; the
full linear Maxwell-Higgs-Weyl BV deformation complex receives
relative/Dirichlet/generalized-APS boundary domains paired with their
cotangent adjoints. Elliptic regularity and compact graph embedding give a
positive self-adjoint compact-resolvent BV Hodge Laplacian and hence a genuine
finite external spectral family.

This closes local analytic existence, not physical promotion. The work below
subsequently closes the ultraviolet Hodge cycle, free finite-shell
QME-preserving pushforward and several presentation-orbit comparisons. The
remaining physical targets include nontransported boundary/sector comparison,
interacting region/limit control and the fixed-coupling gauge-BRST C*-limit.
Comparison of gauge Hadamard orbits, a selected full-branch state, numerical
RG/matching, observable comparison and infrared scattering where required
also remain open.

The regulator route has since advanced beyond that initial cutset. The Hodge
integration cycle and free finite-shell QME pushforward are exact. Based gauge,
residual spatial-frame, spin-liftable diffeomorphism and ambient-isotopic
full-data region transports are quotient-neutral on their certified
presentation orbits. The positive companion is uniquely
`g_E=g_L+2 n_flat tensor n_flat` once a future unit normal is fixed.

`A_causal` does not select a unique normal or temporal function. Instead,
collar-relative temporal companions form one auxiliary local homotopy class.
Every positive BV-Hodge cutoff-crossing shell has
`h_lambda=lambda^-1 Q_dagger`, so its inclusion or removal is an exact strong
deformation retract. This closes temporal-companion independence for
normalized free finite-shell physical observables even though the raw
elliptic symbols differ.

The anomaly-free determinant line is now also separated from its normalization
convention. Its unit parallel trivializations form a `U(1)` torsor;
homogeneous QME/Ward equations preserve that torsor and a common phase cancels
from normalized connected-sector observables. The common absolute phase is
therefore retired as a physical exit at this tier. Relative phases between
disconnected coherent sectors, nontransported determinant holonomy, changes
of boundary/BFV polarization, uniform interacting cutoff removal and the
fixed-coupling interacting C*-limit remain open.

The first noncollar APS target is now reduced exactly. For
`A(s)=diag(-2,s,3)`, the negative projector drops rank `2 -> 1`, spectral flow
is `+1`, and endpoint determinant comparison factors through the
one-dimensional crossing kernel. A `U(1)` stabilizer fixes the operator and
projectors while rotating that line, excluding source-free phase selection.
The unique nontrivial abstract comparison of spectral-flow parity with the
finite q79 shared sign character gives `-1`. This is only a parity shadow:
selection of the physical boundary family, its crossing-line/shared-line
intertwiner and the full eta/Maslov/BFV analytic phase remain open.

That finite crossing now has an exact continuum origin. On the shared circle,
used strictly as a holonomy/Fourier model,
`B_a=-i d/dtheta+a` has a sign-based unit-winding path with one positive
crossing. Its `(-3,-1,2)` Fourier restriction is homotopic through uniformly
gapped spectator modes to `diag(-2,t,3)`.

A chosen cooriented boundary, collar/adapted-operator convention, restricted
physical connection, endpoint transport and zero-mode taming then
functorially determine the tangential Dirac family, APS projectors and BFV
form. A constant path and a unit-winding path share the same sign-holonomy
basepoint but have spectral flows `0` and `1`. Bulk q79 geometry plus the
finite sign therefore cannot select the physical boundary history. The
missing row is now a typed geometric boundary package, not arbitrary matrix
entries.

That package has now been retyped against the actual continuum QFT domain.
The selected theory is boundaryless and its interactions are compactly
supported; the rounded APS boundary is auxiliary regulator data. Under
BV-BFV gluing, the regulated region and its complement carry dual boundary
state lines, so a common boundary phase cancels exactly. The zero local anomaly
vector and zero faithful-`Z6` spin-bordism obstruction remove the corresponding
gauge-anomaly obstructions. Selection of a physical moving regulator boundary,
collar and common BFV polarization phase is therefore retired as a false exit.
Actual relative-sector histories, physical edges if present, finite scheme
matching and uniform regulator removal remain open.

The free regulator limit is now sharper. Compact resolvent canonically gives a
cofinal nested spectral family, with Green tails bounded by the inverse next
eigenvalue and Hodge-homotopy tails by its inverse square root. Nested
finite-shell BV pushforwards compose exactly. An exact four-dimensional
Weyl-scaling model simultaneously proves that these free norm bounds cannot
control local interaction products: the covariance tail tends to zero while
the diagonal trace grows as `N(N+1)/2`. Raw interacting cutoff removal is
therefore excluded without local counterterms. The remaining formal bridge is
one six-row QME-compatible `Z_Lambda` comparison to the already constructed
Epstein-Glaser continuum prescription.

That bridge has now been decomposed without promoting it falsely. An exact
rational Hodge model verifies the smooth heat-semigroup, propagator-shell and
BV homotopy identities. An exact quadratic local counterterm verifies
`Z(0)=0`, `Z'(0)=id`, subtraction and the scale-cocycle law. Together with the
already closed zero-anomaly QME scheme, this supplied the first counterterm
seed.

The analytic `HK` package is now closed on the boundaryless compact-support
formal tier, with one important correction. The compact-resolvent adjoint
Hodge sum on the mixed-order Maxwell detour complex is not Laplace type; an
exact scaling witness excludes that promotion. The corrected blockwise
background-Feynman-gauge Hessian has common Euclidean principal symbol
`|xi|^2 id`. Its interior heat expansion has uniform differentiated
remainders, while auxiliary-boundary dependence is `O(t^infinity)` on compact
interaction support. The global APS trace is retained as a power/power-log
expansion with potentially nonlocal boundary coefficients.

The formal `CT` package is now closed after one necessary presentation
change. Costello's theorem does not accept the ordinary second-order
Maxwell detour as its local gauge-fixing complex. A factorwise first-order
q79 Yang-Mills BV extension instead gives an exact `1 -> 7 -> 7 -> 1`
symbol complex and a local weighted adjoint satisfying
`[Q,QGF]=|xi|^2 id`. Its self-dual auxiliary field eliminates back to
Yang-Mills up to a fixed-sector topological constant. Costello's graphwise
recursion then supplies local counterterms at every finite perturbative
bidegree, and the exact zero anomaly class supplies the BRST primitives in
a compatible all-orders formal scheme.

The remaining `EL` bridge is now sharply cut. The MLD pointwise reflection
`R_n=I-2P_n` has been consumed rather than re-proved, and its exact q79-normal
realizations preserve both the Lorentzian metric and the positive companion.
On a genuine slice-reflection contract, the positive free physical
spectral-shell covariance factorizes as a sum of squared Laplace transforms,
so the gauge-invariant BRST observable algebra is Osterwalder-Schrader
positive at that tier.

That pointwise result does not automatically integrate to a global reflection
isometry. The exact smooth collar
`g_E=d tau^2+(1+tau)dx1^2+dx2^2+dx3^2` has the same metric and normal at the
fixed slice but gives `5/4` versus `3/4` after reflection at `tau=1/4`; its
nonzero extrinsic curvature violates a necessary reflection condition.
Current q79 data are smooth and do not impose even normal jets or reflection
parity on the gauge-Higgs background.

The direct Lorentzian alternative is now closed at the local formal tier. A
positive elliptic Laplace-type operator on all graded Cauchy rows gives a
smooth spectral presentation
`R_epsilon=exp[-epsilon(log 2)A_Sigma]`; Lorentzian Cauchy evolution turns it
into smooth regulated Feynman/Hadamard contractions. A pure BRST Hodge
operator is explicitly not used as the UV generator because it would leave
physical cohomology unsmoothed. The finite regulator is not mislabeled local,
causal or exactly QME invariant. Instead, graphwise local subtraction fills
all six rows of the old cutoff-to-EG contract. The renormalized Lorentzian
prescription lies in the same local normalized Stueckelberg-Petermann orbit
as the existing Epstein-Glaser prescription.

The finite modified Ward identity is restored order by order because the
certified q79 local anomaly class is zero. Local covariance and support
preservation then make the SP comparison commute with the equicausal
time-slice map, closing renormalized Cauchy transport on formal physical
ghost-number-zero cohomology. A physical Wick rotation is therefore not
required for the formal Lorentzian construction. Explicit Euclidean Costello
to Lorentzian EG coefficient equality remains an optional cross-signature
problem. The prior exact flat ambiguity still excludes fixed-coupling
positivity or convergence from the formal jet alone; numerical beta
functions, matching, global state and nonperturbative completion remain open.

The rank-six q79 `P/Q` carrier is not identified with the rank-48 SM matter
carrier. They share the selected spacetime spin factor; a finite-carrier
intertwiner remains open. `B.ACTION.01` also remains open because the
profile-covariant action form does not select all upper q79 action
coefficients.

The first normed fixed-coupling landing is now closed without changing that
boundary. At every finite auxiliary external regulator, compact-gauge Haar
reduction gives a physical Cstar algebra, any declared nonzero finite-rank
interaction Hamiltonian gives automorphic dynamics, and positive
gauge-invariant states exist. An exact rational witness verifies the
fixed-point algebra, Gauss-neutral corner, nonzero-coupling dynamics, tensor
locality and state properties.

Three continuum-promotion theorems are now explicit. A Cstar reduced product
turns norm-vanishing locality and Ward defects into exact limit identities,
but existence of an ultralimit does not imply uniqueness. Alternatively, one
common Banach-valued Nevanlinna-Sokal class uniquely Borel-sums the formal jet
and excludes the prior smooth flat ambiguity. Norm-Duhamel differentiation
now also identifies the common-source auxiliary spectral fixed-coupling
relative-S source/cocycle-generator first tangent with the normalized formal
Lorentzian EG/SP first tangent. The current
acceptance counts are `5/5` for the finite-regulator landing, `1/9` for the
physical Cstar continuum rows and `1/6` for the Borel source rows. Selection
of the q79 external regulator and upper action, higher-jet matching, uniform
locality/energy estimates, limit uniqueness and a global interacting state
remain open. No Cstar-norm convergence of finite-time interacting dynamics
is inferred.

The Gauss/BRST/Ward row has now been split. Compact-gauge Haar fixed points
have exactly zero gauge norm defect at every finite regulator, and the
induced BRST differential on ghost-number-zero physical observables is
exactly zero. Gauge-invariant dynamics preserves both identities, and the
identically zero defect sequences descend through every Cstar reduced
product. The remaining quantum Ward functional on the physical algebra is
the chiral determinant/fermion-measure Jacobian. Thus the Ward row remains
unaccepted but is dependency-reduced to the separate nonperturbative full
nonabelian chiral-measure row. The table stays `1/9`, while the number of
independent open continuum exits falls from eight to seven.
