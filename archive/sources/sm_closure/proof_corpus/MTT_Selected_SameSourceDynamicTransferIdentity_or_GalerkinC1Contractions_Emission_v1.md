# MTT Selected SameSourceDynamicTransferIdentity or GalerkinC1Contractions Emission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_SAMESOURCE_DYNAMICTRANSFERIDENTITY_OR_GALERKINC1CONTRACTIONS_EMISSION_BUILT_NORMAL_FORM_IDENTITY_OPEN`.

This artifact turns the remaining wall into a normal-form identity.

If the selected dynamic transfer emits:

```text
Phi_C1_selected(Z) = phase_packet
Phi_C1_selected(X) = shift_packet
A_selected         = [phase_packet, shift_packet]
b_selected         = phase_packet + shift_packet
G_selected         = A_selected^T A_selected = 12 I_2
```

then:

```text
A_selected^T b_selected = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1           = [1.0, 1.0]
```

So selected promotion is now equivalent to proving that same-source dynamic
transfer identity, or else running an honest selected Galerkin C1 contraction
emission that supplies replacement sector response matrices.

Guardrail: if the selected transfer or honest Galerkin run emits different
values, the conditional Weyl-pair packet remains diagnostic and the emitted
selected equation must be solved instead.

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or lifted
flags are used as selectors.
