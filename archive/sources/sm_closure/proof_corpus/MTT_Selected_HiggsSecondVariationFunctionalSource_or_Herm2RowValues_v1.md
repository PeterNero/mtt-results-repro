# MTT Selected HiggsSecondVariationFunctionalSource or Herm2RowValues v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_HIGGSSECONDVARIATIONFUNCTIONALSOURCE_OR_HERM2ROWVALUES_METRIC_ONLY_NOGO_CLOSED_DYNAMIC_SOURCE_ROWS_OPEN`

## What Closed

- fixed the accepted source routes for the Higgs second variation on `B_Huv`
- proved `G_Q`/`B_Huv^*G_QB_Huv` cannot be promoted to `M_H`
- emitted the exact `SelectedHiggsDynamicStrainKernel` payload spec
- rechecked direct Herm(2) rows after the metric-only no-go

## Key No-Go

`B_Huv^* G_Q B_Huv = I_2`, so the kinematic metric has zero trace-free
Herm(2) part on the whitened domain. If promoted, it would emit
`Delta=Re(Omega)=Im(Omega)=0`, fail non-scalar acceptance, and leave no light
line. The missing object must be a dynamic strain/response source, not the
domain metric.

## Still Open

- selected dynamic strain/response functional `F_H`
- selected `H_response` table or direct `Huu,Hud,Hdd`
- C5b projection-measure equality and C6 no-extra-boundary/source proof
- `K_threshold.Omega_H.lambda` and strict `Omega/lambda_H` execution
