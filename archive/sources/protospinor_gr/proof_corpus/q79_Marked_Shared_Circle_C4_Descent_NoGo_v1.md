## The marked vertical lattice

On the active conditional Fu-Yau topology

```text
X=P_delta x S1_shared,
c=(delta,0),
```

the vertical integral basis has two distinct roles:

```text
e1 = twisted circle carrying delta,
e2 = marked shared untwisted circle.
```

The quarter-turn is

```text
J=[[0,-1],[1,0]],
J e1=e2,
J e2=-e1.
```

It therefore exchanges the marked shared circle with the twisted direction.
It is an automorphism of the four-element unmarked Chern-orbit parent, but not
of one torus bundle with its shared-circle marking.

## Exact stabilizer

An integral orientation-preserving matrix fixing both oriented vectors `e1`
and `e2` is the identity. If both orientations are forgotten, the finite
marked stabilizer is only

```text
{+I,-I},
```

with orders one and two. It contains no order-four element. Hence the current
marked setup cannot use `C4` as an autonomous Lens redundancy.

## The chiral bundle makes the marking physical

The existing smooth non-pullback `SU(3)` construction obtains `c3=+/-6` by
clutching specifically along the untwisted `S1_shared`. Under `J`, that gluing
direction becomes the twisted circle. Thus the displayed chiral payload is not
`C4` equivariant either; parent covariance of curvature cost, Bianchi number,
and gerbe topology does not repair it.

## Scope and surviving exit

This is conditional on identifying the corpus shared circle with the
untwisted Fu-Yau factor. That identification is itself still a primitive-source
premise. But the dichotomy is exact:

```text
if the shared circle is marked, autonomous C4/Lens descent is impossible;
if it is unmarked, the current same-circle gravity source and c3 clutching
must be rederived after quotient.
```

An unmarked modular reformulation must supply five new rows: transport or
forget the marking, reconstruct the same-circle source, descend the chiral
clutching, descend the spectral/gerbe/HYM data, and prove projected-Hessian
invariance. None is present. Lens descent is therefore no longer a shortcut in
the current program.

The two live routes are the genuinely nonlocal same-branch Fourier-Mukai
contract or direct computation of the selected projected HYM block after the
actual bundle and balanced HYM connection exist.

No observed value and no fitted parameter is used.
