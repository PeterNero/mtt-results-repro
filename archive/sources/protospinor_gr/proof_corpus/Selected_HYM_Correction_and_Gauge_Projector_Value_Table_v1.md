# Selected HYM Correction and Gauge Projector Value Table v1

## Result

The selected route now has one honest HYM correction value packet, but not the
full nonlinear connection.

Imported row projector:

```text
P_eta_00(v)=<eta_00^unit,v> eta_00^unit
matrix on <eta_00, complement> = [[1,0],[0,0]]
```

Imported first trace-free HYM correction:

```text
rho = |eta_00^unit|^2
mean(rho) = 0.9999999999999997
Delta phi = rho - 1,  mean(phi)=0
||Delta phi - (rho - 1)||_L2 = 5.588e-16
S_1 = phi * T3
```

The selected direction is `T3`, with `||phi||_L2 =
0.03029206787683036` on the imported `24^4`
FFT/Galerkin table.

## Boundary

This is not the full nonlinear HYM connection and not the full finite gauge
projector.  The row projector is a harmonic seed projector; the full gauge
projector needs the nonlinear `exp(S)` solution, its HYM Jacobian, and the
selected finite coefficient-space inner product.
