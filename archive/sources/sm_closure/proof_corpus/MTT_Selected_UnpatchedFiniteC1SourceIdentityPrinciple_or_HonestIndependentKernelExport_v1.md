# MTT Selected UnpatchedFiniteC1SourceIdentity or HonestIndependentKernelExport v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_UNPATCHEDFINITEC1SOURCEIDENTITY_OR_HONESTINDEPENDENTKERNELEXPORT_BUILT_FINAL_TWO_ROUTE_CONTRACT`

## Theorem

**FinalTwoRouteUnpatchedC1ExecutionContractTheorem.** After the conditional Route-B validator pass, unpatched dynamic C1 closure has exactly two legal finishing routes: derive the SelectedFiniteC1SourceIdentityPrinciple, or emit an honest independent finite C1 kernel export with 110 strict rows. The current repository proves neither route, but it now fixes the validator, row manifest, postcheck-only oracle, and next execution order.

## Result

- Conditional Route B already validates, but unpatched closure is still open.
- Source-identity route: compact and conditional-ready, but not derived unpatched.
- Honest-kernel route: not emitted, but now has an exact 110-row manifest and strict validator boundary.
- The locked target oracle remains postcheck-only and cannot be used as a source.

## Superset Use

The superset strategy is now disciplined into two finishing routes. The source-identity path fuses Route A and Route B into one selected physical/finite trace identity. The honest-kernel path avoids that principle by demanding independent row data. Both routes share the same locked target only as a postcheck.

## Next Artifact

`MTT_Selected_HonestKernelExport_RowSourceFill_or_SourceIdentityDerivationAttempt_v1`

Recommended next move: start filling the honest 110-row kernel manifest, while keeping source-identity derivation as the co-primary route.
