# MTT Selected q79 Signed-Sheet Spin-Lift Reduction v1

## Exact q79 sheet monodromy

The degree-three q79 cover has connected total space, so its generic sheet
monodromy is transitive. The genus-two polarization map is a double cover of
`P2`, hence surjective, and every `PGL(3)` alignment is an isomorphism of that
`P2` with the hyperplane linear system `|3*0|` of the smooth elliptic cubic.
Ordinary tangent lines to a smooth cubic give one double and one simple
intersection point, so the cover has local transposition monodromy. A
transitive subgroup of `S3` containing a transposition is all of `S3`.

Thus the q79 three-sheet monodromy group is structurally

```text
Mon(C/K3)=S3.
```

This result is independent of the numerical `PGL(3)` alignment.

## Binary Spin lift

FB1 replaced the orientation-reversing permutation action by

```text
rho_plus(sigma)=sign(sigma) P_sigma in SO(3).
```

The inverse image of this rotational `S3` in `Spin(3)=SU(2)` is the binary
dihedral group `Dic_3` of order 12:

```text
1 -> {+1,-1} -> Dic_3 -> S3 -> 1.
```

Choose exact quaternion lifts of the adjacent transpositions,

```text
q1=(i-j)/sqrt(2),
q2=(j-k)/sqrt(2).
```

The audit proves exactly

```text
q1^2=q2^2=-1,
q1 q2 q1=q2 q1 q2,
(q1 q2)^3=-1,
|<q1,q2>|=12.
```

So local braid/path monodromy has an exact `Spin(3)` lift. However the central
extension does not split as a representation of `S3`: every lift of a
transposition squares to `-1`, not `+1`. This is exactly the double-return
behavior required by the proto-spinor narrative.

## What remains

The global question is now finite and sharp. One must obtain a presentation of
the actual q79 `K3` sheet-branch complement, lift its generators by the binary
rules above, and evaluate the central sign of every relator. All signs `+1`
prove a strict Spin lift and `w2=0`. A surviving `-1` is the obstruction.

If that obstruction is nonzero, a selected order-two holonomy on the shared
circle could cancel it in a SpinC-type construction. That would use the shared
circle in a mathematically standard way, but it must not be reported as a
strict `Spin(3)` lift unless the obstruction itself vanishes.

Closed here:

```text
q79 sheet monodromy group S3,
binary preimage Dic_3,
non-splitting over S3,
exact local braid lift.
```

Still open:

```text
global q79 relator signs / w2,
extension across the branch locus or smooth HYM replacement,
any selected shared-circle Z2 cancellation,
the actual world-in-world Q/Hessian source.
```

No observed Standard Model value and no fitted continuous parameter is used.
