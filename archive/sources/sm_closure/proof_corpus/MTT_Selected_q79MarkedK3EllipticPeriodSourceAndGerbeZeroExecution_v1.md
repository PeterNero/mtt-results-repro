# MTT Selected q79 Marked-K3/Elliptic Source and Gerbe-Zero Execution v1

Status: `MTT_U6_Q79_ELLIPTIC_MODULUS_REDUCED_TO_Z4_CHERN_ORBIT_BRIDGE_MARKED_K3_AND_PERIOD_ZERO_OPEN`

## Why A107 is needed

A106 reduced the gerbe calculation to one marked splitting-conic K3, one
elliptic modulus and eight solved alignment variables. The corpus also contains
a square `tau=i` Appell-Humbert implementation and repeated lens quarter-turn
language. A107 tests whether that value can lawfully fill the Fu-Yau elliptic
source.

The answer has two parts:

```text
one rank-one Chern branch: no,
four-branch Chern-orbit parent: conditionally yes.
```

## Single-branch order-four no-go

Write the Fu-Yau Chern pair as the integral column

```text
c0=(delta,0)^T.
```

For `M=[[a,b],[c,d]] in SL(2,Z)`, the equation `M c0=c0` forces

```text
a=d=1, c=0,
Stab(c0)={[[1,n],[0,1]] : n in Z}.
```

This parabolic stabilizer has no nontrivial finite-order element. If `c0` and
`-c0` are identified, `-I` adds order two, but still no order four.

For the quarter-turn

```text
J=[[0,-1],[1,0]],  J^2=-I,  J^4=I,
```

one has

```text
J(delta,0)=(0,delta).
```

Thus a global lens quarter-turn cannot be a symmetry of one selected
`(delta,0)` Fu-Yau bundle. This retires the direct `complex nesting => tau=i`
shortcut on the single branch.

## Minimal Z4 Chern-orbit superset

The minimal `J`-invariant completion is

```text
(delta,0)
 -> (0,delta)
 -> (-delta,0)
 -> (0,-delta)
 -> (delta,0).
```

With the square fiber metric all four representatives have curvature cost
four and the same source-free allocation

```text
9+11+4=24.
```

This adds no continuous parameter. A later orientation selector may choose one
representative, just as an oriented universe can select one member of a parent
conjugacy orbit. That physical interpretation is conditional until MTT derives
the parent orbit and the selector on this same carrier.

The Poincare construction is natural under elliptic automorphisms. Hence
gerbe triviality and nonzero Jacobian determinant are invariant across this
orbit after transporting the spectral cover and integral branch. One exact
A106 period execution suffices for all four representatives.

## When order four selects tau=i

On a marked elliptic curve the quarter-turn acts modularly as

```text
tau -> -1/tau.
```

An integral origin-preserving order-four automorphism therefore requires

```text
tau=-1/tau,
tau=i in the upper half-plane,
j(E)=1728.
```

The inverse generator gives `-i`; both orientations belong to the same
unoriented square elliptic curve.

This statement requires a *global integral automorphism*. Every elliptic
fiber already has a tangent complex structure, but that local `J^2=-1` does
not force its period lattice to be square.

Consequently:

```text
strict present branch: 19 unselected complex geometric moduli,
conditional Z4 parent: 18 unselected complex K3 moduli, tau=i fixed.
```

## Corpus and retarded guard

The complex-nesting corpus calls the lens quarter-turn plausible and
structurally supported; it also explicitly says complex nesting does not by
itself prove the finite quotient. It does not act on the Fu-Yau Chern pair.

The U9 q79/q369 packet proves an antiunitary orbit and selects q79 after
retarded orientation. This is the right pattern, but it is not yet a typed map
to the four Fu-Yau Chern orientations. Reusing it without a same-carrier
functor would be another cross-source shortcut.

The missing theorem is now exact:

```text
LensQuarterTurnToFuYauChernOrbitSourceTheorem.
```

It must place the lens quarter-turn on the integral lattice of this Fu-Yau
fiber, select the four-element parent orbit, and prove that the MTT orientation
selector descends to one Chern representative while preserving the Strominger
and normalized-Poincare data.

## Remaining frontier

A107 conditionally removes the elliptic modulus but does not select a marked
K3 point and does not prove the gerbe zero. The next constructive choice is:

1. prove the Chern-orbit source theorem, then select or execute one point in
   the 18-dimensional splitting-conic K3 family; or
2. directly insert a smooth marked K3 and produce an exact gerbe zero/no-go
   certificate, which decides existence but not unique MTT vacuum selection.

No observed value and no new fitted continuous parameter enters A107.
