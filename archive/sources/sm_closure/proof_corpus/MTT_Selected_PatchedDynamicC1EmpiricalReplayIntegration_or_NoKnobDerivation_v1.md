# MTT Selected PatchedDynamicC1EmpiricalReplayIntegration or NoKnobDerivation v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PATCHEDDYNAMICC1EMPIRICALREPLAYINTEGRATION_OR_NOKNOBDERIVATION_BUILT_REPLAY_INTERFACE_UPDATED`.

Patched dynamic C1 is now integrated into the empirical replay interface:

```text
patched C1 empirical interface ready = True
A_selected                           = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
b_selected                           = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1                        = [1.0, 1.0]
full SM parity closed                = False
true SM equivalence closed           = False
```

Measured Yukawa, CKM/PMNS, Higgs, and gauge values remain downstream SM-parity
inputs, not selectors. The next work is the final gap matrix / closure attempt:
common-scale Yukawa/Higgs transport, covariance/profile execution, selected SM
packet integration, local QFT observable functor, and GR/QM interfaces.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_FinalSMParityGapMatrix_or_ClosureAttempt_v1`.
