  We close the selected MTT source question one layer deeper than the previous
  Fourier-transport attempt.  The MTT corpus supplies the structural data for a
  selected nontrivial Z3 family phase-space: the central circle gives three
  character sectors, nil termination gives three survivor basins, the
  circle-lens-nil architecture supplies genuine cocycle data, and the
  Strominger/gerbe selection theorem selects fixed differential-cohomology
  sectors.  The finite calculation then shows that the only nontrivial flat
  Z3 gerbe labels are the rank-two Heisenberg labels m=1,2, both with zero
  finite Bianchi residual.  Together with the qutrit polarization lemma, this
  proves that MTT selects the gerbe-Fourier qutrit type up to the global
  conjugate orientation.  It does not yet prove the ordered SU(5) matter-slot
  packet U_10=I_3, U_bar5=F.

  Selected Gerbe-Fourier Type Theorem

# Target

The previous target was the exact ordered packet:

```text
U_10 = I_3,
U_bar5 = F.
```

That target has two logically separate layers:

```text
Layer 1: MTT selects the nontrivial Z3 gerbe/qutrit Fourier phase-space type.
Layer 2: MTT assigns the ordered SU(5) slots 10_M=clock, bar5_M=shift,
         with q79 orientation F rather than the conjugate orientation F*.
```

This note proves Layer 1 and records why Layer 2 remains open.

# Corpus Inputs

The MTT corpus supplies four structural ingredients.

```text
1. circle-lens-nil tri-layer geometry has genuine triple-overlap cocycle data;
2. the central circle carries the Z3 family holonomy;
3. holonomy-aware nil termination gives exactly three survivor basins;
4. the Strominger/gerbe selection theorem selects fixed topological sectors
   under the twisted gap and bounded-projector hypotheses.
```

These are not flavor fits. They are upstream MTT geometry statements.

# Finite Calculation

On the finite base `F_3^2`, take the flat torsion B-period:

```text
B_m((a,b),(a',b')) = m*(-a' b)/3 mod Z.
```

The script checks all triples in `F_3^2` and finds:

```text
m=0: Bianchi residual zero, commutator rank 0;
m=1: Bianchi residual zero, commutator rank 2;
m=2: Bianchi residual zero, commutator rank 2.
```

Thus `m=0` is the trivial non-family phase space, while `m=1,2` are exactly
the nontrivial finite Heisenberg/qutrit phase spaces.  This agrees with the
four-route torsion selector: all routes reject `m=0` and leave the conjugate
pair `{1,2}`.

# Fourier Consequence

For a nontrivial qutrit Heisenberg carrier, the finite Stone-von-Neumann
calculation is already closed:

```text
clock polarization -> shift polarization = F,
opposite orientation -> F*.
```

Therefore selected MTT geometry now proves:

```text
nontrivial Z3 gerbe/Fourier qutrit type is selected,
the selected type is the conjugate pair {F,F*},
the unselected fixture represents a member of this selected type.
```

# What Is Still Not Proved

The exact ordered SU(5) packet is stronger.  It requires:

```text
10_M is the selected clock Lagrangian/polarization,
bar5_M is the selected shift Lagrangian/polarization,
the q79 representative chooses F rather than F*,
the selected projector retains these matter slots,
the selected D_E/dotD, typed monad/Cech, or equivalent source supplies the
same ordered bases.
```

The current data do not yet supply that ordered matter-slot source.  The C6
orientation data reduce the branch space to a global conjugate pair, but do
not select one conjugate convention without an orientation-carrying operator
or fixed representative convention.

# Verdict

Closed now:

```text
MTT selects the nontrivial gerbe-Fourier qutrit type up to conjugation.
```

Still open:

```text
MTT selects the exact ordered SU(5) packet U_10=I_3, U_bar5=F.
```

So the correct next proof target is no longer the whole gerbe source.  It is
the narrower ordered Lagrangian/matter-slot theorem:

```text
selected MTT source places 10_M in the clock polarization and bar5_M in the
shift polarization, with the q79 branch choosing F.
```
