# MTT Selected q79 Hidden Bundle Existence, Bianchi Allocation, and Spectrum Execution v1

Status: `MTT_U6_EXACT_MINIMAL_FUYAU_ALLOCATION_AND_STABLE_BUNDLES_CLOSED_FULL_HOLONOMY_AND_CHIRAL_VISIBLE_SOURCE_OPEN`

## What A102 closes

A101 proved that the second `E8` bundle was missing from the typed source and
ruled out abelianizing it with only two Fu-Yau curvature embeddings. A102 now
constructs the strongest exact source-free nonabelian candidate: a stable
`SU(3)` bundle with `c2=9`, a stable hidden `SU(9)` bundle with `c2=11`, and a
rank-one Fu-Yau torus class of norm four. It proves the bundle-existence and
HYM gates, executes the hidden `E8` branching and cohomology, and identifies an
important visible-sector obstruction that prevents overclaiming.

## q79 Mukai kernel and repair

For the selected q79 Mukai vectors

```text
a=(5,H,0), b=(7,3H,1), H^2=2,
```

the first-Chern map is `(x,y)->(x+3y)H`. Its unique primitive kernel is
`(x,y)=(3,-1)`, hence

```text
3a-b=(8,0,-1), c2=9, v^2=16.
```

This is not an honest bundle: it is exactly Yoshioka's `l-omega` exceptional
case, whose moduli contains only non-locally-free sheaves. Adding the Mukai
vector of a length-two ideal sheaf gives

```text
(8,0,-1)+(1,0,-1)=(9,0,-2), c2=11, v^2=36.
```

The repaired vector is primitive and has stable locally free representatives.
The numerical coincidence with `q7=2` is not promoted: the corpus contains no
theorem mapping the CP residue `q7` to an ideal-sheaf length.

## Minimal rank-one Fu-Yau allocation

Inside `Lambda_K3=U^3+E8(-1)^2`, choose

```text
h=e1+f1,       h^2=2,
delta=e2-2f2,  delta^2=-4, h.delta=0.
```

An integral ASD `(1,1)` class orthogonal to an ample K3 class cannot have
square `-2`: one sign would be effective by K3 Riemann-Roch and would have zero
intersection with an ample class. Since the lattice is even, four is therefore
the minimal nonzero curvature cost, and `delta` attains it.

Taking `[omega1/2pi]=delta` and `[omega2/2pi]=0`, the dimensionless Fu-Yau
integrability row is exactly

```text
c2(V3)+c2(W9)-delta^2 = 9+11+4 = 24.
```

This is a smooth source-free candidate with zero NS5 charge. Its remaining
discrete source premise is explicit: MTT must identify the corpus's unique
shared degree-zero circle with the untwisted Fu-Yau factor and select the
primitive norm-four companion class. The corpus supports the first phrase in
its flavor geometry but does not yet make this Fu-Yau identification.

## Stable HYM bundles exist

The explicit stable-bundle bound reported by Li and Qin gives a stable locally
free `c1=0` rank-`r` bundle on a K3 whenever `c2>r+1`, since `p_g(K3)=1`.
Both candidates pass strictly:

```text
SU3: c2=9 > 4,
SU9: c2=11 > 10.
```

Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau supplies irreducible HYM connections. The two reduced
bundle moduli spaces each have expected complex dimension `36+2=38`. Thus no
measured fit parameter was added, but existence is not unique selection: 76
complex reduced bundle-moduli directions remain unfixed.

## Exact hidden E8 execution

With the Bourbaki `E8` Cartan matrix, the highest-root coefficients are
`(2,3,4,6,5,4,3,2)`. Delete affine node 2. The remaining roots

```text
alpha1-alpha3-alpha4-alpha5-alpha6-alpha7-alpha8-alpha0
```

have the `A8` Cartan matrix, determinant nine and lattice index three. This is
the maximal `SU(9)/Z3` subgroup of `E8`, with

```text
248 = 80 + 84 + bar84,  84=Lambda^3(9).
```

For `c2(W9)=11`, exact Chern-root and K3 index calculations give

```text
h1(End0 W9)=38,
h1(Lambda^3 W9)=63,
h1(Lambda^3 W9*)=63,
total=164=2*(30*11-248).
```

If `Hol(W9)=SU(9)`, its centralizer in `E8` is finite `Z3`; no continuous
hidden gauge factor or hidden gaugino condensate remains. Stability alone does
not prove full `SU(9)` holonomy. The 126 transverse `84+bar84` deformations show
that the reduced locus sits inside a much larger `E8` deformation space, but
MTT still has to select or constructively certify a full-holonomy point.

## Visible chirality no-go

The same K3 calculation gives

```text
h1(K3,V3)=h1(K3,V3*)=3.
```

These are three `27` slots and three conjugate slots, not three net families.
For the standard Fu-Yau pullback, `c3(pi*V3)=0`. On a complex threefold with
`c1(T)=c1(V)=0`, Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch gives

```text
chi(V)=1/2 integral c3(V).
```

Therefore every K3-pullback `SU(3)` bundle has zero four-dimensional chiral
index. The exact `h1=3` coincidence is structural evidence only. A physical
three-family exit needs a stable non-pullback bundle on the Fu-Yau threefold
with `integral c3=+/-6`, plus the same-branch HYM and Bianchi certificate.

## Remaining cutset

1. Prove the shared-circle-to-rank-one-Fu-Yau source map.
2. Construct/select a non-pullback visible `SU(3)` bundle with `c3=+/-6`.
3. Select or constructively certify full hidden `SU(9)` or `E8` holonomy.
4. Supply the seven numerical NS5 values required by A101's exact A98 bound.
