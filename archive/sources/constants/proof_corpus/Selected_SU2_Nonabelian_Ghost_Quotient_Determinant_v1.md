# Selected SU2 Nonabelian Ghost Quotient Determinant v1

## Purpose

This note attacks the remaining SU2 gate:

```text
Does the nonabelian Faddeev-Popov quotient determinant add a finite
weak-split threshold term beyond the scalar sphere/Casimir piece?
```

The result is a sharp reduction, not final closure.

## Inputs

The exact selected scalar-proxy sphere piece is:

```text
p_scalar(SU2) = -0.5980970589159109.
```

The current SU2 Casimir heat coefficient candidate is:

```text
C_A(SU2) = 2.
```

So the previously retained candidate is:

```text
p_SU2 = 2 p_scalar = -1.1961941178318218.
```

## Source Constraints

The gauge-fixing source gives:

```text
M_G[A] = partial^mu D_mu[A].
```

For a general nonabelian background this operator depends on the gauge field.
Therefore the SU2 ghost determinant cannot be discarded by the same argument
used for the abelian Qc circle block.

Theta II gives a helpful but incomplete clue.  In the lens sector the effective
geometry is the constant-curvature two-sphere, and the massless gauge harmonic
is constant on the lens layer after gauge fixing.  This supports a flat or
universal FP branch, but it does not by itself prove the full determinant
policy for the selected threshold operator.

BRST sources supply the quotient discipline: ghosts are quotient-measure
bookkeeping, and physical observables live in BRST cohomology.  They do not
select a finite internal determinant sign by target matching.

## Computed Branches

### Flat Universal Or Absorbed Ghost

If the selected SU2 threshold background is the constant flat representative,
then:

```text
M_G[A] -> -Delta_0 tensor ad(SU2).
```

The raw flat adjoint determinant candidate is:

```text
dim ad(SU2) p_scalar = 3 p_scalar = -1.7942911767477327.
```

If the physical quotient discards this as a field-independent universal
projection Jacobian, or absorbs it into the already selected Casimir heat
coefficient, then the extra ghost finite term is zero and the SU2 block stays:

```text
p_SU2 = -1.1961941178318218.
```

This is the closure branch we want, but it is not selected yet.

### Explicit Flat Adjoint Sign Branches

If the raw flat adjoint determinant is kept explicitly, two sign conventions
are possible before the quotient convention is fixed:

```text
p_SU2 = 2 p_scalar - 3 p_scalar =  0.5980970589159109,
p_SU2 = 2 p_scalar + 3 p_scalar = -2.9904852945795546.
```

Both are diagnostic branches only.  Choosing either sign because it improves
or worsens the electroweak comparison would be a fitted sign choice, not a
theorem.

### Curved Nonabelian FP Operator

If the selected SU2 threshold background is genuinely non-flat, the required
operator is:

```text
M_G[A] = partial^mu D_mu[A]
```

with selected connection, curvature endomorphism, domain, zero-mode removal,
and BRST determinant sign.  Its zeta determinant must then be computed
directly.

## Conditional Theorem

The exact statement that would close SU2 is:

```text
Selected_SU2_Threshold_Background_is_Flat_and_FP_Determinant_is_Universal_or_Casimir_Absorbed.
```

Under that statement, no new finite ghost term enters the weak split, and the
SU2 block is:

```text
p_SU2 = C_A(SU2) p_scalar = -1.1961941178318218.
```

This is not a fitted sign choice; it is a quotient/flatness theorem.

## Verdict

We did not close SU2 completely.

We did isolate the final missing statement.  The remaining proof is no longer
"handle ghosts" in general.  It is:

```text
prove the selected SU2 threshold background is flat/universal for the
Faddeev-Popov determinant, or else supply the selected non-flat FP spectrum.
```

Next gate:

```text
Selected_SU2_Threshold_Background_Flatness_or_FP_Spectrum_v1.
```
