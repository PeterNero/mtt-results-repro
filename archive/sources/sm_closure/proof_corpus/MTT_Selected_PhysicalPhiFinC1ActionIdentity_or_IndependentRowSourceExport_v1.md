# MTT Selected PhysicalPhiFinC1ActionIdentity or IndependentRowSourceExport v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHYSICALPHIFINC1_ACTIONIDENTITY_OR_INDEPENDENTROWSOURCEEXPORT_BUILT_CONDITIONAL_EXITS_VERIFIED`.

This artifact turns the source frontier into an acceptance contract. The actual current packet still fails the strict two-exit validator. Two conditional witnesses are included only to prove sufficiency: Route A validates if the same-source physical `Phi_fin^C1` action identity emits the finite C1 source packet, and Route B validates if an independent selected row-kernel/Hessian export emits the rows without residual-projector replay or locked targets as source.

The result preserves the superset strategy: one straight same-source path and one independent export path are both allowed, but both must lock to the same downstream postchecks only after source emission.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RouteA_PhysicalActionIdentityProof_or_RouteB_IndependentRowSourceTable_v1`.
