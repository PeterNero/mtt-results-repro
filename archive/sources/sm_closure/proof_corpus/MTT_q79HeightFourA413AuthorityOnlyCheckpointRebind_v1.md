# MTT q79 Height-Four A413 Authority-Only Checkpoint Rebind v1

The regenerated A400, A404, A405, A410, and A411 packets differ from their Git baselines only in their enumerated authority hashes. The regenerated A413 manifest consequently differs only in those five parent authority hashes. This certificate rebinds the 75 complete A414 checkpoints to the current A404 and A413 hashes while proving that every normalized numerical checkpoint payload is unchanged.

This is not a replacement for producer replay. The native A414 and A415 builders and their dedicated auditors must run after the rebind.
