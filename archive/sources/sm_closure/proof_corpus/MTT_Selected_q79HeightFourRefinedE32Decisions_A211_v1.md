# MTT Selected q79 Height-Four Refined E32 Decisions A211 v1

## Result

A211 replaces A210's correlated primitive-handle sums with direct survivor
transports. It uses direct A combinations for all four survivors, a direct
`B:a1+B:b2` combination for rank 3, and chooses the narrowest certified B
enclosure for ranks 2 and 4 from the primitive and high-order candidate-direct
transports. It also chooses the narrowest certified selected-side beta interval
without changing its center or branch.

The refinement rejects 1 additional fixed-grid survivor(s) and
leaves 3 E32-nonseparated. Nonseparation is not equality and
is not promoted to a covariant solution. Conversely, fixed-carrier rejection
does not rule out a zero at another PGL3 alignment. No observed Standard Model
value is used.
