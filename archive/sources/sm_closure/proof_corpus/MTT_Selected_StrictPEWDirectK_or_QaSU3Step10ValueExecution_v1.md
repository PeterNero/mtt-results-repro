# MTT Selected StrictPEWDirectK or QaSU3Step10ValueExecution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_STRICTPEWDIRECTK_OR_QASU3STEP10VALUEEXECUTION_BUILT_STEP10_CLOSED_FULLS2_AND_PEW_OPEN`

## Closed Now

The Qa/SU3 Step10 side is no longer open at the source-rule layer:

- Route A selected physical `Phi_fin^C1` source rule: closed
- selected dynamic `Phi_fin/C1` payload: emitted
- `A_selected`, `b_selected`, `deltaTheta_C1`, sector response matrices:
  promoted
- first selected dynamic value rows: `2`

The accepted first dynamic rows are:

- `VSD-01.phase.I_plus_Z.u.first_dynamic_row`
- `VSD-01.phase.I_plus_Z.e.first_dynamic_row`

## Still Open

The strict `P_EW` / direct-K side remains at zero rows:

- strict `P_EW` rows: `0`
- direct `K_threshold.Omega_H.lambda` rows: `0`

Full S2/no-proxy rows are also still open.  The current full-S2 obligation
count is `5`, with
`1` closed after the
first dynamic-row acceptance.

## Next Target

Next required artifact: `MTT_Selected_FullS2NoProxyRows_or_StrictPEWNormalizationPayload_v1`.
