# MTT Selected VariationOperatorShapeCompatibility or HessianSourceGap v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_VARIATIONOPERATORSHAPECOMPATIBILITY_BUILT_HESSIAN_SOURCE_GAP_OPEN`

This step proves shape compatibility for the dynamic variation operators. The
existing source-map candidate supplies `phase_R_Z` and `shift_R_X` residual
operator shapes, and the selected slot table routes them across all `72`
primitive row slots: phase on `u,e`, shift on `d,nuD`.

This is not source promotion. The operator shapes remain unselected as physical
source data, and the Hessian counterterm / `b_selected` source vector is still
missing.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_HessianCountertermSourceAndBVectorTheorem_or_PhysicalPhiFinC1Emission_v1`.
