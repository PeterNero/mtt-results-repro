# MTT Selected q79 Twisted Spectral Gerbe Lift, HYM and Bianchi Execution v1

Status: `MTT_U6_Q79_SPECTRAL_DD_RESTRICTION_ZERO_FLAT_ANALYTIC_BRAUER_RESIDUE_HYM_BIANCHI_OPEN`

## Exact advance

A104 consumes A103's degree-three determinant-zero cover and computes the
gerbe obstruction on that same q79 rank-one Fu-Yau branch. It closes the
integral obstruction exactly. It does not promote the remaining holomorphic
gerbe residue, HYM connection or Bianchi representative without their source.

## Spectral surface topology

Put `J=K3 x E`, let `A=p_K3^*H`, and let `B=p_E^*(3[0])`. A smooth generic
spectral surface has class `D=A+B`. Since `H^2=2` and `deg(3[0])=3`,

```text
A^2 B = 6,
D^3 = 3 A^2 B = 18,
c2(J).D = 24*3 = 72.
```

Adjunction and Noether's formula therefore give

```text
K_C^2 = 18,
c2(C) = 18+72 = 90,
chi(O_C) = (18+90)/12 = 9.
```

Lefschetz gives `pi1(C)=pi1(K3 x E)=Z^2`, hence `q=1`. It follows that

```text
p_g=9,
h11=74,
b(C)=(1,2,92,2,1),
H^3(C,Z)=Z^2.
```

The last equality matters: there is no hidden torsion class after the two
integral pairings vanish.

## Integral gerbe restriction theorem

For the rank-one principal elliptic bundle with torus Chern pair `(delta,0)`,
the standard dual Poincare gerbe on `J` has, up to exchanging a fiber basis
`u,v`,

```text
DD(alpha)=delta cup u in H^2(K3,Z) tensor H^1(E,Z).
```

Every class in `H^1(C,Z)` is the restriction of a linear combination of
`u,v`. For either generator `a`, the Poincare pairing is

```text
integral_C i^*(delta cup u) cup i^*a
  = integral_J delta cup u cup a cup (H+3[0]).
```

The same-fiber-basis term vanishes by antisymmetry. The other is proportional
to `delta.H`, which is exactly zero on the A102 q79 lattice. Thus both
pairings vanish. Since `H^3(C,Z)=Z^2` is torsion-free, Poincare duality proves

```text
i^* DD(alpha)=0 in H^3(C,Z).
```

This is stronger than a de Rham cancellation: the integral class itself is
zero, and no torsion escape remains.

## The remaining analytic residue

Integral DD vanishing is necessary but not sufficient for a holomorphic
trivialization. The exponential sequence leaves

```text
beta_C in H^2(C,O_C) / image H^2(C,Z),
dim_C H^2(C,O_C)=p_g=9.
```

`beta_C` is one selected geometric class to compute, not nine fitted
observable parameters. A rank-one inverse-gerbe twisted spectral sheaf exists
exactly when this class is trivialized. The present repositories do not emit
the same-branch Cech cocycle or a trivializing cochain, so A104 records
`beta_C=0` as undecided.

The nearby q79 order-three flat deck gerbe is conditional on an Iwasawa deck
scaffold and is not the present Fu-Yau Poincare gerbe. The Qa/SU3 gerbe packet
itself labels the q79 class an adjacent guardrail rather than a same-source
promotion. Neither may fill this gate by import.

## Explicit closing object

The generated open-input packet now states the required calculation rather
than another generic existence request. It needs:

1. a marked q79 K3 period/sextic realizing `H,delta`, an elliptic period, and
   the selected `PGL(3)` alignment;
2. the actual spectral equation and a good cover of `C`;
3. the Fu-Yau torsor transitions and relative Poincare discrepancies;
4. the restricted scalar Cech 2-cocycle and either a trivializing 1-cochain
   or a nonzero `beta_C` period certificate.

If the result is zero, the next execution is the inverse Fourier-Mukai
transform, local-freeness/determinant check, balanced stability/HYM, and then
the full differential Bianchi identity. If it is nonzero, the current
rank-one spectral candidate is ruled out and one must change the cover or use
higher-rank twisted spectral data.

## Bianchi guard

The A102 equation `9+11+4=24` remains the exact K3 reference allocation, but
it is not the differential Bianchi proof for a non-pullback visible bundle.
The actual visible Chern-Weil form, hidden SU9 HYM form, torsion connection and
global `H`/Deligne representative must be placed in one equation. A104 keeps
that gate open. A103's full hidden `SU(9)` holonomy and finite `Z3` commutant
remain closed.

## Current result

Closed now:

```text
spectral surface topology,
integral DD restriction = 0,
torsion loophole = absent,
remaining obstruction = one explicitly typed flat holomorphic class beta_C.
```

Still open:

```text
beta_C Cech/period decision,
twisted rank-one spectral object,
locally free non-pullback SU3 transform,
balanced HYM,
differential Bianchi,
threshold and NS5 numerical rows.
```

No measured value and no new fitted continuous parameter is used.
