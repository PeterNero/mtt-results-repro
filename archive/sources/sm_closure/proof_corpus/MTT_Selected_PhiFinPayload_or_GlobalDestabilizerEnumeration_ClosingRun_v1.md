# MTT Selected PhiFinPayload or GlobalDestabilizerEnumeration ClosingRun v1

This artifact reconciles the older Qa/SU3 slot frontier with later stationary
`Phi_fin` work.

It closes one additional operator-source slot:
`Riesz_Green_dotD_projector_retention`.

The closure uses a superset path, not a single straight path:

- gauge-transported End0/HYM `Phi_fin` trace
- symbolic transport-conjugation validator replay
- same-branch cross-repo alpha1/`dotD` import

The selected source value is stationary only: transported projectors,
Riesz/Green retention, validator-ready `rho_s`, and same-branch `dotD`.

It does not close the same-source Chern-Weil row, the selected HYM/Route-C
residual, the full transition `rho_E`/Cech-Dolbeault `D_E` payload, or the
finite determinant/torsion response.

Current count is now four closed operator-source slots and four open slots.

External theorem shapes used as guidance only: Li-Yau/Kobayashi-Hitchin
stability-to-HYM, and Riesz/Galerkin spectral projection convergence.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_ChernWeilHYMDE_or_DeterminantTorsion_FourSlotClosingRun_v1`.
