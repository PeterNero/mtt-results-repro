# PrimitiveC1 Contractions or DynamicOverlapTensor SourceEmission Import v1

Status: `PRIMITIVEC1_CONTRACTION_ENVELOPE_IMPORTED_DYNAMIC_VALUES_OPEN`.

## Result

The selected static route plus finite primitive candidates now produces a routed
contraction envelope:

```text
active shift = [1, 1]
fixed fiber class = [0, 1, 2]
phase route = ['u', 'e']
shift route = ['d', 'nuD']
all fixed-fiber candidates rank three = True
max absolute entry = 0.34195899479289005
```

## Boundary

The envelope is not a selected dynamic tensor and not selected primitive C1
contractions. The honest and formal Galerkin manifests still record missing
primitive contractions, so `A_selected`, `b_selected`, `deltaTheta_C1`, sector
response matrices, and flavor closure remain open.
