# q79 F3x2 Discrete-Torsion Modular-Orbit Theorem v1

Date: 2026-07-16

## Exact finite theorem

The selected time-oriented q79/F gerbe has finite quotient `G=F3^2` and

```text
c((a,b),(c,d)) = zeta_3^(-c b).
```

Its discrete-torsion commutator phase is

```text
epsilon(g,h)=c(g,h)/c(h,g)=zeta_3^(a d-b c).
```

The executable calculation checks all `9^3=729` cocycle equations and all
`9^2=81` torus twist sectors. There are no failures. Under

```text
S:(g,h)->(h,-g),
T:(g,h)->(g,g+h),
```

the phase is unchanged in every sector. The finite actions also obey
`S^2=(ST)^3=charge conjugation`. The phase multiplicities are exactly
`33,24,24` for exponents `0,1,2`; 48 sectors carry nontrivial torsion phase.

## What moved

The finite q79 gerbe contribution to a torus orbifold sum is no longer an open
modular-phase guess. Its complete discrete-torsion `S,T` orbit is exact.
The 81 sector labels form exactly seven modular orbits:

```text
rank 0: 1 orbit of size 1,
rank 1: 4 orbits of size 8,
rank 2: 2 determinant-labelled orbits of size 24.
```

Consequently the missing oscillator/gauge character problem reduces to seven
seed character blocks and their factorization data, not 81 independent blocks.

## Honest boundary

This does not construct a full heterotic torus partition function. The
oscillator characters, gauge/current lattice, spin structures, GSO phases,
q79 sigma-model measure, and factorization coefficients remain absent.
Therefore the exact q79 worldsheet CFT and string UV-inheritance theorem remain
conditional on the full character packet.
