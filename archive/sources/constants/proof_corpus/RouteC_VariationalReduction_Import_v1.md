# RouteC Variational Reduction Import v1

Status: `ROUTEC_VARIATIONAL_REDUCTION_IMPORTED_C1_DEFECT_SOURCE_OPEN`.

The unpatched C1 route has advanced from an axiom-shaped gap to a variational
source gap.  The finite Euler projection is derived, and the orthogonal
completion rule is reduced to selection of the C1 defect/leakage functional.

Current replay remains:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

Still not claimed: selected C1 defect functional, physical `Phi_fin^C1`
application rule, independent quadrature/Hessian solve, unpatched SM dynamic
closure, or true SM equivalence.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_C1DefectFunctionalSource_or_IndependentQuadratureDataFill_v1`.
