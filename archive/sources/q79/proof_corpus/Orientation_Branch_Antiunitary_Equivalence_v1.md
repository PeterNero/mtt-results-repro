title: "Orientation Branch Antiunitary Equivalence"
version: v1
---

# Result

The current q79 and q369 branch-smoke operator packets are finite antiunitary
conjugates.

The comparison checks:

```text
D_E action,
reduced Green operator,
dotD_alpha1 response.
```

Across all seven sectors, the script compares 1629 finite entries.  The
maximum conjugation error is:

```text
1.2412670766236366e-16
```

No entry differs above tolerance.

# Interpretation

This closes the finite branch-pair comparison.  The two packets are not two
unrelated mathematical branches at the finite operator layer; they are the same
operator data up to antiunitary conjugation:

```text
m=1, q=79, F     <->     m=2, q=369, F*
```

The source flags remain false on both sides.  Therefore this does not choose
q79 over q369, and it does not compute the primitive C1 contractions or Yukawa
matrices.

# Remaining Theorem

One of the following must still be supplied:

```text
a selected source or retarded boundary theorem that breaks the antiunitary pair,
or a proof that physical predictions are orientation-invariant up to CP-odd sign
until such a theorem is supplied.
```
