# MTT Selected Route-C Rank2 L2 Cohomology or Route-C Residual Fill

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEC_RANK2_L2_COHOMOLOGY_FILL_CLOSED_STABILITY_OR_ROUTEC_RESIDUAL_OPEN`

The rank-two lane has advanced. The q79 terminal-admissible-section packet
passes the finite L2 cohomology validator:

- `h1 = 8`.
- The selected Ext vector is closed.
- The selected Ext vector is not exact.
- No observed or benchmark flavor inputs are used.

The ordered source packet also passes its validator and quotients `Pic0` for
the ordinary Chern/H1/curvature layer. That quotient is not promoted to the
operator layer, because holonomy-sensitive `D_E` and `dotD` data may see flat
twists.

## What Closes

- Selected L2 cochain/Ext packet.
- Nonzero Ext input for the non-split `V_alpha` route.
- Ordered `L = (1,-2,0)` source at the Chern/H1 layer.
- Pic0 quotient for the ordinary Chern/H1/curvature layer.

## What Remains Open

- Unconditional terminal section theorem in the MTT spine.
- Non-split stability/HYM or selected Route-C residual.
- Operator-layer Pic0 recheck.
- Same-source Chern-Weil/Green-Schwarz derivation.
- Same-source selected `rho_E`, `D_E`, Riesz/Green, and `dotD`.
- Primitive C1 contractions.

Thus the rank-two arithmetic fill is no longer the blocker, but the selected
operator source is still open.
