  We close the CP-character identification gate for the Mukai Z_7 block,
  conditional only on MTT selecting the Mukai discriminant quotient.  For the
  positive Mukai rank-two lattice P spanned by a=(5,H,0) and b=(7,3H,1), the
  discriminant group A_P=P^*/P is cyclic of order seven.  In MTT, recordable
  CP phases are finite unitary characters of the selected quotient.  Therefore
  once the Fu-Yau/K3 fixed sector selects P as the family-trivial odd CP
  quotient, the physical odd CP label group is necessarily
  Hom(A_P,U(1))~=Z_7.  This closes the identification of CP labels with the
  unitary dual.  The fixed-sector selection reduction now proves that a
  supplied Bianchi-compatible Fu-Yau/Mukai sector carries A_P to the selected
  MTT fixed point; what remains is global construction or selection of that
  sector and Fu-Yau anomaly compatibility.

  Mukai Z7 CP Character Identification Theorem

# Purpose

The Mukai arithmetic is complete:

```text
A_P = P^*/P ~= Z_7.
```

The remaining phrase in older notes was:

```text
prove the CP labels are Hom(A_P,U(1)).
```

This paper closes that identification under the standard MTT finite-character
observability principle.

# Inputs

## Mukai discriminant group

Let `P` be the integral Mukai lattice spanned by:

```text
a=(5,H,0),
b=(7,3H,1),
H^2=2.
```

Its Gram matrix is:

```text
K_Mukai =
[[2,1],
 [1,4]].
```

Thus:

```text
A_P=P^*/P ~= Z_7.
```

## MTT finite-character observability

The selected-kernel and finite CP quotient papers use the MTT observability
contract:

```text
recordable CP phases are unitary characters of the selected finite quotient.
```

In other words, once the physical CP quotient is `G`, the CP phase labels live
in:

```text
Hom(G,U(1)).
```

# Theorem: CP Character Identification

Assume the Fu-Yau/K3 fixed sector selects the family-trivial odd CP quotient:

```text
G_7 = A_P = P^*/P.
```

Then the physical odd CP phase labels are:

```text
Gamma_7 = Hom(A_P,U(1)).
```

Since:

```text
A_P ~= Z_7,
```

we get:

```text
Gamma_7 ~= Z_7.
```

## Proof

By assumption, the selected finite odd CP quotient is `A_P`.  By MTT
finite-character observability, recordable CP phases on a finite quotient are
unitary characters of that quotient.  Therefore:

```text
Gamma_7 = Hom(A_P,U(1)).
```

The unitary dual of a finite cyclic group of order seven is again cyclic of
order seven.  Hence:

```text
Gamma_7 ~= Z_7.
```

This proves the identification.

# Explicit Generator

The discriminant generator may be represented by:

```text
theta_7=(1/7,5/7).
```

It satisfies:

```text
K_Mukai theta_7 = (1,3).
```

Thus it defines a unitary character of order seven.  The seven characters are:

```text
j theta_7, j=0,...,6.
```

# What This Closes

```text
CP labels are Hom(A_P,U(1)) once A_P is selected      CLOSED
odd factor Gamma_7 ~= Z_7                             CLOSED
explicit theta_7 generator                            CLOSED
```

# What Remains

This theorem does not globally construct or choose the topological sector
containing `P`.  The fixed-sector selection reduction closes the local MTT
selection step once that sector is supplied.  The remaining gates are:

```text
1. Fu-Yau/Strominger anomaly compatibility for the charge sector;
2. global selection or construction of the determinant-seven Mukai sector P;
3. locally-free/HYM interpretation if the physical model requires bundles
   rather than stable sheaf charge sectors.
```

# Bottom Line

The character-identification gate is closed.  The open `Z_7` issue is now
selection and physical realization, not character algebra.
