# Selected PhiFin S2 Selected Operator and Truncation Source Theorem Attempt v1

## Result

The selected full-operator/truncation theorem was attempted and is blocked by
explicit source obligations.

Status: `SELECTED_PHIFIN_S2_SELECTED_OPERATOR_TRUNCATION_THEOREM_ATTEMPT_BLOCKED`

This is a negative but useful theorem attempt. The current corpus proves a
same-basis 27-mode model-active replay with a positive model gap, but it does
not prove that the model-active operator is the selected full
Iwasawa/Strominger `D_E` trace.

## Current Gap Data

```text
model-active gamma_N: 4.386490844928603
model-active epsilon_N: 0.0
model-active epsilon < gamma: True
selected gamma_N: None
selected epsilon_N: None
selected gap condition passes: False
```

The model-active gap cannot be relabelled selected because the selected full
operator and the full-minus-model norm bound have not been emitted.

## Blocking Theorem Slots

- `I3_smooth_bn_galerkin_lift_theorem`: prove smooth `B_N` convergence and
  full Iwasawa/Strominger truncation error.
- `I4_selected_DE_action_and_source_flags`: derive `D_E` from the selected
  connection and prove the 27-mode matrix is its N=1 truncation.
- `I5_dotD_alpha1_and_C1_response`: derive same-branch `alpha1`, selected
  `dotD`, horizontal response, and overlap/C1 data.

## Verdict

Selected S2 value emission cannot be promoted from the current corpus alone.
The next real artifact must supply either a full operator error bound or a
source theorem deriving those three theorem slots.
