# MTT Selected DynamicC1TransferTensor or GalerkinC1Values v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_DYNAMICC1TRANSFERTENSOR_OR_GALERKINC1VALUES_BUILT_OPERATOR_ALPHA1_CLOSED_PRIMITIVE_TENSOR_OPEN`.

Closed support now carried into the dynamic frontier:

```text
static Weyl-pair provenance       = closed
stationary projector/Riesz/Green  = closed
alpha1/dotD driver                = closed
transport-only C1 lane            = rejected
```

The conditional dynamic tensor normal form is built but not promoted:

```text
rank = 2
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0]
```

The live frontier is now only value emission: selected non-invariant primitive
C1 tensor, selected Hessian/source vector `b_selected`, or honest selected
Galerkin C1 values.

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target
residuals are used as selectors.
