# Selected SU2 Threshold Background Flatness or FP Spectrum v1

## Purpose

The previous gate reduced the SU2 ghost determinant problem to:

```text
prove the selected SU2 threshold background is flat/universal,
or compute the selected non-flat Faddeev-Popov spectrum.
```

This note closes the flatness half.

It does not yet close the quotient-normalization policy for the resulting flat
adjoint determinant.

## Source Proof

Theta II gives the Route A SU2 lens model:

```text
Sigma_2 is the effective constant-curvature S2 lens layer.
The massless gauge harmonic is constant on Sigma_2 after gauge fixing.
```

Theta III gives the independent Route B twistor normalization:

```text
the SU2 twistor action is linearized about the trivial bundle,
the massless twistor harmonic is constant along the fiber,
I_2^(0) = 4 pi (f2 R_lens)^2.
```

Together these select the leading SU2 threshold background as the
trivial-bundle constant massless zero mode.

## Flatness Consequence

For the nonabelian Faddeev-Popov operator:

```text
M_G[A] = partial^mu D_mu[A],
```

the selected leading background has:

```text
A = 0.
```

Therefore:

```text
M_G[A] -> -Delta_0 tensor ad(SU2).
```

So the genuinely non-flat FP spectrum is not needed at this leading threshold
gate.

## Computed Flat Determinant Data

The exact scalar sphere finite part is:

```text
p_scalar = -0.5980970589159109.
```

The current gauge-block candidate is:

```text
C_A(SU2) p_scalar = 2 p_scalar = -1.1961941178318218.
```

The flat adjoint FP determinant, if retained explicitly, is:

```text
dim ad(SU2) p_scalar = 3 p_scalar = -1.7942911767477328.
```

## What Remains

flatness is closed.

policy is still open:

```text
Should the flat adjoint FP determinant be discarded as pure quotient-measure
normalization, absorbed into the Casimir heat coefficient, or retained as a
separate gauge-factor finite threshold?
```

The preferred closure branch from the quotient discipline is:

```text
discard or absorb the field-independent FP determinant.
```

But that policy must be source-certified before we promote SU2 into selected
lambda_12 accounting.

## Verdict

We have eliminated the need for a non-flat SU2 FP spectrum at the leading
threshold background.

The remaining gate is:

```text
Selected_Flat_FP_Quotient_Normalization_Policy_v1.
