# PostAlpha WeylPair Transfer Reduction v1

## Result

Primitive-only C1 is now retired as the direct splitter source:

```text
primitive-only target in span = false
fixed-fiber residual ratio = 0.7772815877574014
```

The enriched Weyl-pair route is algebraically sufficient:

```text
phase Z -> u,e as I+Z
shift X -> d,nuD as I+X
conditional rank = 2
conditional deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0000000000000002]
```

The selected source-level `Z/X` carrier and active shift `(1,1)` are proved,
and the conditional source-to-C1 transfer map is exact. The remaining blocker
is selected sector routing plus selected normalization, after which
`A_selected` and `b_selected` can be emitted and the honest splitter solve can
run.
