Status: `MTT_CONST_HIGGS_01_H7B1I_MSOURCE_RESPONSE_PREFIX_CONTRACT_BUILT_VALUE_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-HIGGS-01 / HIGGS-QUARTIC-THRESHOLD / H7B1I-MSOURCE-FROM-SELECTED-RESPONSE-PREFIX`

## Result

```text
selected response prefix imported          True
selected D_E/gap/Riesz/Green layer closed  True
H-sector rank-two zero-cluster support     True
M_source acceptance functor built          True
M_source value emitted                     False
H_uv / Omega / s_beta / lambda_H           False
strict no-knob Higgs closure               False
```

## Construction Contract

If the dynamic payload is later emitted, the accepted source operator is:

```text
H_response = Hess_response restricted to the selected finite source space
M_source = (R_H^* H_response R_H + (R_H^* H_response R_H)^*)/2
H_uv = B_Huv^* M_source B_Huv
```

Here `R_H` is the same-source H-sector restriction map.  `B_Huv` is still a
separate payload; it is not needed to verify `M_source`, but it is required to
compute `H_uv`.

## Why No Value Yet

The selected trace payload closes only the stationary finite trace
`D_E/gap/Riesz/Green` layer.  It does not emit the selected tangent/response
driver, finite dynamic Hessian/mass-strain block, H-sector restriction map, or
Hermitian `M_source` entries.
