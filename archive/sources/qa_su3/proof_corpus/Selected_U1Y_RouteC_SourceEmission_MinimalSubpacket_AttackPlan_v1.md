The seven-field same-source packet is now decomposed into the smallest
source-emission gates that can make the validator pass. The first true
gate is not a numerical overlap calculation; it is the selected
operator-source identity bridge.

A useful update from the q79 side is retained: older ordered-source
validator failures are now retired after terminal-lockdown attempts.
The live blocker is therefore sharper: operator-layer Pic0, same-source
Chern-Weil/GS, D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD, and primitive C1 data.

## Dependency Order

### 1. S1_source_identity_bridge

Next artifact: `Selected_U1Y_RouteC_OperatorSourceIdentity_Bridge_Subpacket_v1`.

Every same-source field depends on one selected visible/Route-C/V_alpha operator-source identity; current source-level S3/GS support is not enough.

Must emit:
- selected q79/F,m=1 visible bundle/sheaf, V_alpha, or finite Route-C source identity
- same-source bridge from selected S3/Green-Schwarz support to the operator source
- Pic0 selection or physical quotient rule at the operator layer
- HYM/Strominger residual or Route-C residual with selected_source_verified true

### 2. S2_operator_values_payload

Next artifact: `Selected_U1Y_RouteC_DE_DotD_Green_SourceEmission_Subpacket_v1`.

D_E, Riesz/Green, and dotD are the validator backbone; they must be emitted after, and from, the selected operator source.

Must emit:
- selected D_E action for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H or the U1/Y reduced sector
- selected Riesz projector and reduced Green operators
- selected dotD_alpha1 with same-branch derivative verification
- coherent spectral projector retention for the same source

### 3. S3_matter_overlap_payload

Next artifact: `Selected_U1Y_RouteC_MatterSlot_Overlap_SourceEmission_Subpacket_v1`.

Matter-slot charge, the 1_M neutrino rule, overlap transfer, and normalization cannot promote while the sector basis/operator source is support-only.

Must emit:
- selected matter-slot charge table: 10_M -> u/e and non-10 plus 1_M -> d/nuD
- selected 1_M Dirac-neutrino routing rule
- selected source-to-C1 overlap-transfer functor
- selected trace/inner-product/Hessian normalization

### 4. S4_primitive_contractions_payload

Next artifact: `Selected_U1Y_RouteC_PrimitiveC1_Contractions_Subpacket_v1`.

Primitive C1/Yukawa contractions are last: they require selected source identity, operators, sector routing, and overlap normalization.

Must emit:
- 24 primitive C1 contraction matrices or a reduced U1/Y theorem explaining the quotient
- zero-mode response orientations
- explicit vertex and basis-connection data
- proof the contractions are theorem-derived from the same source

## Acceptance Contract

Every required field must satisfy:

- `selected_emitted = true`
- `same_source = true`
- `theorem_derived = true`

The packet must also set `one_same_source`, `promote_to_A_selected`,
and `promote_to_b_selected` to true while keeping observed data and
target fitting false.

Forbidden provenance remains: support-only shapes, locked target
selection, fixtures, lifted flags, observed data, and benchmark matrices.
