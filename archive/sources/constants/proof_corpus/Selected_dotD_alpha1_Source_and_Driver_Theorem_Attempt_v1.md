# Selected dotD alpha1 Source and Driver Theorem Attempt v1

## Result

Status: `SELECTED_DOTD_ALPHA1_SOURCE_AND_DRIVER_THEOREM_NOT_PROVED_CRITERION_SHARPENED`

The theorem is not proved yet.  The current data close the zeroth-order
selected `D_E` gap layer and supply same-basis finite `dotD_alpha1` value
matrices, but they do not select the alpha1 tangent/driver that makes those
matrices theorem-derived.

## Requirements

```json
{
  "R0_selected_D_E_gap_layer": true,
  "R1_selected_projective_rhoE_trace": true,
  "R2_same_basis_dotD_value_packet": true,
  "R3_operator_level_projector_retention_for_dotD": false,
  "R4_selected_alpha1_deformation_parameter": false,
  "R5_retarded_overlap_derivative_source": false,
  "R6_honest_dotD_replay_without_lifted_flags": false
}
```

## Obstruction

```json
{
  "exact_missing_object": "An operator-level selected alpha1 deformation/retarded-overlap derivative source, in the locked F3xF3 B_N basis, proving that the existing dotD matrices are the derivative of the selected Phi_fin source rather than a diagnostic source-lift.",
  "not_a_gap_problem": true,
  "not_a_projector_cleanliness_problem": true,
  "not_a_shape_problem": true,
  "why_D_E_lock_does_not_imply_dotD": "The D_E theorem selects the zeroth-order finite trace and gap/Riesz/Green layer. dotD is a first variation along an alpha1 deformation; selecting the value of D_E does not by itself select the tangent vector or retarded driver."
}
```

## Next Payload
