Status:
`Q79_COMPLEMENT_QUARTERTURN_HESSIAN_SCALARIZATION_CLOSED_CONDITIONAL_LANE_TO_FUYAU_Z4_SOURCE_FUNCTOR_AND_ACTUAL_HYM_EXISTENCE_OPEN`

## Result

The two still-free equalities in the projected HYM/TT block have an exact
symmetry solution. It is conditional on one sharply identified same-carrier
source theorem, not on a numerical fit.

## Canonical lane quarter-turn

The unique positive `S3`-equivariant complement map sends each sheet atom to
its opposite unordered edge. In the ordered bases

```text
vertices: (1,2,3),
edges:    (23,13,12),
```

its matrix is the identity. On the two-copy strain carrier define

```text
J_DE(d,e)=(-e,d),
J_DE=[[0,-I3],[I3,0]].
```

The exact calculation gives

```text
J_DE^T J_DE=I6,
J_DE^2=-I6,
[J_DE,rho(sigma)]=0 for every sigma in S3.
```

This is a parameter-free orthogonal complex structure on the diagonal/edge
multiplicity plane. It is not automatically the common central circle: that
central phase cancels in endomorphism conjugation, whereas `J_DE` exchanges
the two strain copies.

## Hessian scalarization

Before the quarter-turn is imposed, a self-adjoint `S3`-equivariant operator on

```text
W=2*trivial direct-sum 2*standard
```

has six real coefficients. Lane exchange alone leaves four and still permits
diagonal-edge mixing. Requiring commutation with `J_DE` leaves exactly two:

```text
H=kappa_trivial*(P1 direct-sum P1)
 +kappa_standard*(Pstd direct-sum Pstd).
```

Therefore the physical standard-isotypic multiplicity block is

```text
H_std=kappa_standard*I2,
h_DE=0,
h_DD=h_EE=kappa_standard.
```

Strict stability gives `kappa_standard>0`. Thus quarter-turn invariance proves
exactly the two equations isolated by the spectral sheet-symbol theorem. The
numerical value of `kappa_standard` remains the one action normalization, not a
new dimensionless matrix parameter.

## Fu-Yau comparison

A107 independently computes the same abstract order-four matrix on the Fu-Yau
Chern pair:

```text
J_T2=[[0,-1],[1,0]].
```

It also proves a decisive global distinction. The single branch `(delta,0)`
has a parabolic stabilizer and no order-four symmetry. Its unique minimal
quarter-turn completion is

```text
(delta,0) -> (0,delta) -> (-delta,0) -> (0,-delta).
```

The four branches have equal curvature cost and Bianchi allocation, and the
square-fiber quarter-turn conditionally selects `tau=i`. This is the correct
superset lane.

The representation-level matrices now agree exactly, but the same-carrier
functor is still open. The corpus has not proved that the Fu-Yau Chern-pair
multiplicity plane acts as `J_DE` on the diagonal/edge spectral strain symbol,
nor that the selected HYM functional is invariant under it. Calling the two
quarter-turns identical before that theorem would be a cross-source shortcut.

## Sharp closing theorem

The remaining symmetry route is:

```text
LensQuarterTurnToFuYauChernOrbitSourceTheorem
  + induced action on the spectral sheet-symbol multiplicity plane
  + invariance of the selected HYM functional
  => [H_std,J_DE]=0
  => H_std=kappa_standard I2.
```

The direct alternative is to construct the actual inverse Fourier-Mukai/HYM
bundle and calculate the `2x2` block, then verify the same two equations.

## Scope

Closed here:

```text
canonical complement lane complex structure,
exact S3 plus quarter-turn Hessian commutant,
conditional TT block scalarization,
single-branch order-four no-go,
minimal four-branch Fu-Yau parent,
abstract Z4 representation match.
```

Still open:

```text
typed lane-quarter-turn/Fu-Yau same-carrier functor,
selected HYM action invariance under that quarter-turn,
gerbe branch and inverse Fourier-Mukai/HYM existence,
numeric kappa_standard and primitive Lorentzian branch selection.
```

No observed value and no fitted parameter enters this theorem.
