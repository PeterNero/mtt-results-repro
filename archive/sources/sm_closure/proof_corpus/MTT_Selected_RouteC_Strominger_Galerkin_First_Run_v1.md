# MTT Selected Route-C/Strominger Galerkin First Run

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEC_STROMINGER_GALERKIN_FIRST_RUN_MANIFEST_FILLED_SELECTOR_OPEN`.

The first-run manifest is now filled.  The root files are the honest q79 current-branch finite Route-C smoke payload; their selected-source flags remain false.  A separate `formal_lift_diagnostic` directory tests the same downstream algebra under lifted selected-source flags, but this is diagnostic only and is not proof data.

Path type:

- Straight path: honest import of the current q79 finite payload.
- Superset convergence: locked q79/F,m=1 S3/GS target checked through Route-C residual, rhoE, metric, sector, D_E, Riesz, Green, and dotD validators.
- Superset repair: the missing object is now narrowed to selected-source provenance plus quotient-valid basis data.
- Diagnostic/backfit: no observed masses or mixings are used; lifted flags are not promoted.

What this achieves:

- All declared manifest paths now exist.
- The honest root payload remains unselected, exactly as it should.
- Formal-lift lower validators all pass: `True`.
- Formal-lift promotion gate passes at the finite de_response level: `True`.
- Proof promotion remains forbidden because selected-source flags are asserted in the diagnostic rather than derived from MTT.

Consequence:

The blocker is not currently a hidden finite matrix-shape failure.  The hard remaining gate is to derive the selected HYM/Strominger source and quotient-valid Galerkin basis from the MTT branch itself, then rerun the same manifest without lifted flags.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RouteC_Source_Selector_and_Basis_Theorem_v1`.
