# MTT Selected CycleExit MinimizerTrace or IndependentQuadratureRows v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_CYCLEEXIT_MINIMIZERTRACE_OR_INDEPENDENTQUADRATUREROWS_REDUCED_FIRSTVARIATION_OR_PRIMITIVE_ROWS_OPEN`.

Closed prerequisites:

```text
stationary trace component      = True
dotD/alpha1 C1 source component = True
formal C1 defect functional     = True
basis rows selected             = 19/19
dynamic trace binding           = True
```

Remaining exit:

```text
Route A = physical first variation + boundary cancellation
Route B = 72 primitive rows + 2 Hessian rows + 36 sector rows
target  = A^T A=12 I_2, A^T b=(12,12), deltaTheta_C1=(1,1)
```

This uses the superset strategy as prerequisite sharing only: the straight
minimizer route and independent quadrature route remain separate, both locked
to the same target, and no measured SM constants are selectors.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_FirstVariationBoundary_or_PrimitiveQuadratureRows_ValueFill_v1`.
