# Selected PhiFin S2 27-Mode Provenance Theorem Attempt v1

## Result

Status: `CONDITIONAL_PROVENANCE_THEOREM_CLOSED_UNCONDITIONAL_MORPHISM_OPEN`

The conditional theorem is proved. The unconditional provenance theorem is not
yet proved.

## What Closes

If a finite trace morphism identifies the emitted 27-mode matrices as the
selected `Phi_fin/Strominger` compression, then the existing diagnostic eta
becomes selected:

```text
eta = 1.0
threshold = 2.1932454224643014
passes = True
```

So the numerical perturbation budget is ready.

## Why It Still Does Not Fully Close

The current corpus does not yet prove:

```text
FiniteTraceMorphismIdentifies27ModeScaffold
```

Statement:

```text
The finite Phi_fin/Galerkin-Cech trace of the S0 selected smooth Strominger/HYM minimizer, restricted to B_N = F3xF3_gerbe_twisted_fourier_N1_rank3, equals the emitted 27-mode D_E stiffness matrices sector-by-sector, with the Higgs-sector rank-one shift accounted for by the same selected source.
```

## Required Payload

- selected connection or rho_E finite trace values on B_N
- operator equality or certified form equality between Phi_fin trace and 27-mode matrices
- branch preservation for q79/F,m=1 S3/GS Route-C
- proof that matrices are not fixture/model-active substitutes
- honest validator replay without lifted source flags for D_E/Riesz/Green
