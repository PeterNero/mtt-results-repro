# QFT02 Temporal-Companion Free-Shell Independence

## Result

The remaining Cauchy-normal/Euclideanization coordinate is now closed for
normalized free finite-shell BV observables on one rounded q79 chart,
relative to a fixed boundary collar.

`A_causal` selects the future/retarded component but does not select a unique
temporal function. The admissible collar-relative temporal functions are
joined by

```text
tau_s=(1-s)tau0+s tau1.
```

Convexity of one timelike cotangent cone keeps this path temporal. Equal first
jets on the boundary collar keep the companion metric and boundary domain
fixed there.

## New proof step

For every positive BV-Hodge eigenvalue,

```text
h_lambda=lambda^-1 Q_dagger
Q h_lambda+h_lambda Q=I.
```

Hence a positive mode crossing a finite cutoff is an acyclic shell. The
certificate checks an exact six-to-two projector-rank crossing at cutoff
`9/4`: four rows leave the finite spectral projector, while an explicit
strong deformation retract preserves two physical cohomology rows.

This removes the common-gap assumption from the normalized free comparison.
Gapped segments use Kato transport; positive crossing segments use BV
contraction.

## Compatibility with the prior boost no-go

The prior result remains true. The rational future-normal path connects

```text
n(0)   = (1,0,0,0)
n(1/2) = (5/3,-4/3,0,0),
```

and the scalar symbol changes from `1` to `41/9`. The regulators are not
pointwise equal or isospectral. Their normalized free physical outputs agree
only after the certified BV pushforward.

## Frontier

Closed:

- no unique temporal function follows from `A_causal`;
- collar-relative temporal companions form one auxiliary local component;
- positive finite-cutoff crossings are contractible BV shells;
- normalized free finite-shell observables are temporal-companion
  independent.

Open:

- absolute unnormalized determinant phase;
- changes of boundary collar or BFV polarization;
- uniform interacting cutoff removal;
- fixed-coupling interacting C*-completion;
- nonperturbative completion.

No physical parameter, fit or observed input was added.
