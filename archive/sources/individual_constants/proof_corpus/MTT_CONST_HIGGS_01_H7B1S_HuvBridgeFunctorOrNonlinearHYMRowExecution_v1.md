## What Moved Forward

H7B1S imports the strongest near-hits and sorts them without overclaiming:
section-ring `H_u/H_d` channel labels, exact first C1 row `4/3`, the finite raw
terminal `N_MTT` source operator, and the selected diagonal HYM first solve are
all real support.  None yet emits the UV Higgs-plane binding or a Hermitian
`Huv` row.

## Remaining Boundary

The remaining theorem is now sharply minimal:

`SelectedUVHiggsPlaneBindingAndLightLineSourceTheorem`

It must bind the selected terminal source and diagonal HYM rank-2 lane to
`E_H^UV=span(H_u,H_d^dagger)` and emit either a selected light-line/projector or
direct `Huu,Hud,Hdd` rows.
