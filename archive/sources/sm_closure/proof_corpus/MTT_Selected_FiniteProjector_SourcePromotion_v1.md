# MTT Selected FiniteProjector SourcePromotion v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FINITE_PROJECTOR_SOURCE_PROMOTION_PROVED_DOTD_OPEN`.

## Theorem

The finite HYM-projector values now promote to selected stationary source data
in the transported frame:

```text
U = exp(-u ad(T3))
P_s^sel = U P_s^model U^-1
G_s^sel = U G_s^model U^-1
rho_candidate -> rho_s on im(P_s^sel)
```

The raw untransported `B_N` packet is not promoted.  The selected object is the
exact symbolic transport-conjugated packet.

## Proof Chain

1. The bridge theorem proves that same-source selected projectors with rank,
   gap, Gram, and `End0`-equivariance promote `rho_candidate` to `rho_s`.
2. The finite projector packet emits the needed model-frame values:
   rank-3 matter projectors, rank-1 Higgs projector, positive gap, ordered
   zero-mode basis ids, and exact `End0`-equivariance.
3. Raw equality is false because the selected diagonal connection is
   `D=d+du ad(T3)`.
4. Gauge transport fixes the mismatch: `D_sel U = U d`, so selected projectors
   are `U P U^-1`.
5. The symbolic validator replay proves all finite projector/Riesz/Green/source
   identities by exact conjugation.  The raw truncated residual remains
   `0.23373530261576297`, while the gauge-frame residual
   is `8.863447760090952e-16`.

Therefore `selected_source_verified` and validator-ready stationary `rho_s`
are now theorem-derived for these finite projector values.

## Boundary

This closes stationary finite projector source promotion only.  It does not
close `dotD_alpha1`, the selected alpha1 driver, matter-slot routing, primitive
`C1` overlaps, or full SM no-knob closure.

No measured constants, benchmark targets, or lifted selected flags are used.
