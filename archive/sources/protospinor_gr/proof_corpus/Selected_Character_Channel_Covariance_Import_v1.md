# Selected Character-Channel Covariance Import v1

## Result

The selected internal covariance gate can be imported from the non-SM constants
repo, with the branch caveat kept explicit.

Closed on the selected character-channel branch:

```text
selected character = q_64=15
selected channel   = E_15 K_64
Q_char             = E_15 = |15><15|
K_ret action       = unit phase on |15>
d_Q                = ||D_raw||^2 = 1.0
G_11               = 1.0
```

At the final selected internal radius:

```text
R_star   = 4.44052818226982
||U||    = C_UV_internal = 0.405623467693425
rho_UV   = 0.164530397543639
s_star   = 1.46464677470183
```

So the GR/protospinor physical normalization chain no longer has an internal
`Q_tau` blocker on this selected branch. The remaining physical formula is:

```text
Lambda_gap_phys = sqrt(15) * Omega_0 / s_star
```

## Caveat

This import is conditional on the same premise as the non-SM certificate:

```text
The rho_UV unresolved disturbance channel is the selected q64=15 character channel, not a full-register deck-position covariance or a trace-one mixture over all 64 characters.
```

It does not claim closure for all covariance models, deck-position covariance,
or trace-one mixtures over all 64 characters.

## Remaining Gate

Only the physical unit remains:

```text
Omega_0
```

No observed Newton, Planck, cosmological, TeV, or particle-mass value is used.
