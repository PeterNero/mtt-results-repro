# Selected Route-C Payload Value Import Attempt v1

## Result

The selected matter payload import was attempted against the latest q79 and
sm-parity Route-C/Strominger/Galerkin artifacts.

The honest result is blocked, but sharply:

```text
manifest data exist
formal/lifted diagnostic pipeline exists
sector projector and dotD model-active data exist
selected-source promotion is still open
primitive C1 contractions are still open
```

Therefore no selected matter stress coefficients can yet be imported into the
GR response theorem.

## Why It Does Not Promote

The available `D_E`, Green, dotD, sector-projector, and C1 files are support
or diagnostic payloads. They still carry unselected flags such as:

```text
selected_by_mtt = false
selected_source_verified = false
alpha1_driver_verified = false
proof_promotion_allowed = false
```

Promoting those would be exactly the kind of hidden fitting/flag-lifting the
program is designed to avoid.

## Next Required Object

```text
MTT_RouteC_Selected_Source_Origin_Lemma_v1
```

or, if the source origin is supplied independently:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Splitter_Source_Emission_Contract_or_Selected_DeltaTheta_C1_Solve_v1
```

Only after that can the selected payload template be filled and the GR
stress-response coefficients be promoted.
