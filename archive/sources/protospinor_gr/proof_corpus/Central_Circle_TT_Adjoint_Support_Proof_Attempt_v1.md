# Central Circle TT Adjoint Support Proof Attempt v1

## Attempted Theorem

Prove:

```text
Pi_exact64 B^* P_TT = B^* P_TT.
```

## What The Corpus Gives

Three routes were tested.

1. The central-circle route gives a strong physical selector: the central circle
   is the unique shared coherence channel, and gravity operates on that shared
   channel.

2. The GR route gives coherent-sector completeness: physical long-wavelength
   content is exhausted by the observable projection.

3. The capacity route gives gravity as the geometric bookkeeping of coherence
   capacity under locality and diffeomorphism invariance.

Together these make the exact-support theorem highly natural, but they still do
not identify the support projector of `B^*P_TT` with `Pi_exact64`.

## Why The Direct Proof Fails

The central-circle paper explicitly labels its shared-channel gravity claim as
interpretive synthesis rather than a standalone theorem. GR completeness says
the physical content lies in the coherent projected image, not which finite
subprojector inside that image is selected. Capacity bookkeeping identifies the
geometric role of gravity, but it does not compute `DG(Psi*)` or `B^*P_TT`.

The earlier exact-support no-go is decisive: there are models satisfying the
already sourced assumptions with nonzero TT propagation while placing
`B^*P_TT` outside `Pi_exact64`.

## Conditional Proof

If we add the single selection premise:

```text
support projector of B^*P_TT = Pi_exact64
```

on the selected exact GR/QG branch, then the proof is immediate.

1. `B^*P_TT` is the correctly typed physical TT internal support and is nonzero.
2. The selection premise gives `Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT`.
3. Weight `2` and BRST compatibility are already closed.
4. The Z64 uniqueness theorem forces the support to be
   `|d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}`.
5. Exact-branch compression gives internal normalized `lambda_GR,TT=15`.

## Conclusion

The theorem is not provable unconditionally from the current source set. It is
provable from exactly one additional selection premise, and that premise is now
isolated with no remaining algebraic ambiguity.
