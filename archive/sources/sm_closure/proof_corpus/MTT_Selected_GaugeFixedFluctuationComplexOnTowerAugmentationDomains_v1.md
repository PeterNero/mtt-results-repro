# MTT Selected Gauge-Fixed Fluctuation Complex on Tower-Augmentation Domains v1

## BRST determinant theorem

For a four-dimensional gauge field in background Feynman gauge with internal positive Hessian `H`,

```text
Delta_1 = I4 tensor H,       gauge weight = +1/2,
Delta_0 = H,                 complex ghost weight = -1.
```

Therefore

```text
(1/2) logdet(Delta_1) - logdet(Delta_0)
= (4/2-1) logdet(H)
= logdet(H).
```

This closes the previously open A73 determinant multiplicity. For the q block the one-form domain
has dimension `4*16*7=448`, while the internal Hessian has dimension `112`.

## Character-orbit routing theorem

The exact branch has `q7=2`, which is primitive in `Z7`, while the lepton branch is sevenfold-neutral.
A unital star-closed fluctuation algebra containing a primitive character contains its full cyclic
orbit; deleting the invariant character therefore forces `Aug(C[Z7])` and its rank-six projector
`P7` on the q route.

The lepton baseline is `16 mod 64`, an element of order four. Its powers and adjoint are
`1,i,-1,-i`; deleting the invariant character forces `Aug(C[Z4])` and rank-three `P4`. Thus the
projector assignment follows from the selected finite characters rather than the A72 residual grid.

## Exact A73 execution

The BRST-normalized q derivative is

```text
delta_q = T79*(6/7)*(1/16)Tr(L64^-1)
        = 0.00054764669736074092.
```

On the Lens carrier, the selected quarter-character rank-one trace gives

```text
(1/4) log Delta79 = T79 = 0.025423931732681797.
```

The augmentation return gives `(3/4)delta_q`, hence

```text
delta_e = T79+(3/4)delta_q = 0.025834666755702354.
```

Both match A72/A73 to floating residual below `1e-15`, with zero new continuous parameters.

## Remaining physical gate

The gauge-plus-ghost subcomplex and character routing are closed. Strict physical promotion still
requires `MTT_Selected_ProductTripleGaugeFluctuationFunctorAndRelativeBoundaryCondition_v1`: the selected MTT product triple must place the gauge/ghost fields on these exact
domains, prove fermion/Higgs and other blocks are q79-neutral or cancel, use one BRST background and
zero-mode policy, and derive the universal A51 tree boundary as the complete relative matching
condition. Modern precision validation follows after that source theorem.
