```

The same-source Chern-Weil/Phi_fin value lane now has a unique
support value: `N_alpha1(h_ext)=1`. It is not yet a selected proof
value, because the current q79/SM reductions still leave selected
matter-slot charge, singlet routing, overlap functor, and transfer
normalization open.

## Theorem

The same-source Chern-Weil/Phi_fin alpha1 functional has a unique current support value on the emitted h_ext tangent, namely N_alpha1(h_ext)=1 with zero tangent residual in the filled SM value packet. This is the only value compatible with the U1/Y source-strength criterion du/dalpha1=h_ext. However, the value is not proof-usable until a same-source selected matter-slot charge and overlap-normalization theorem promotes the Phi_fin alpha1 packet; the newest q79 Weyl-pair and SU(5)/E6 reductions still leave that selected transfer normalization open. Therefore the value functional is reduced to one exact theorem gate, but alpha1_driver_verified remains false in this repository.

## Promotion Boundary

If the selected matter-slot charge and overlap-normalization theorem
closes, this packet promotes `du/dalpha1=h_ext`, flips
`alpha1_driver_verified` by theorem, and triggers honest dotD replay.
Until then, the support value is preserved but not used as proof.
