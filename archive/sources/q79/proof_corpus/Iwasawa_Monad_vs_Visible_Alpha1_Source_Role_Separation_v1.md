title: "Iwasawa Monad vs Visible Alpha1 Source Role Separation"

abstract: |
  The printed Iwasawa three-family monad and the visible alpha_1 Chern-Weil
  source have different topological jobs.  The monad supports c1=0, c2=0, and
  int c3=6, making it a matter/zero-mode and rank-one E6 seed candidate once
  typed maps are supplied.  The visible source target, after the stable-source
  sign gate, is c1=0 and c2=+4 alpha_1.  Therefore the printed monad cannot by
  itself be the selected visible alpha_1 source.  Any larger-bundle escape must
  recompute total Chern classes, zero modes, D_E, dotD, Riesz/Green, and
  projectors from the enlarged selected source.

# Purpose

The current proof stack has two nearby but distinct objects:

```text
Iwasawa three-family monad,
visible alpha_1 Chern-Weil source.
```

They should not be silently identified.

# Monad Role

The Iwasawa monad gate records:

```text
c1(E) = 0,
c2(E) = 0,
int_X c3(E) = 6.
```

This supports:

```text
net chirality three,
rank-one E6 cubic seed,
possible matter/zero-mode source after typed maps are supplied.
```

But the same gate also records that the typed monad maps are missing:

```text
explicit f_i sections: missing,
explicit g_i sections: missing,
H^1(X,E) representatives: missing,
sector projections: missing,
D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green: missing.
```

So the monad is not yet a selected operator source.  More importantly for this
packet, its second Chern class is zero.

# Visible Source Role

The visible source target, after the sign correction, is:

```text
(1/(8*pi^2)) Tr(F wedge F) = +4 alpha_1,
c2(V_visible) = +4 alpha_1,
ch2_math(V_visible) = -4 alpha_1.
```

Thus the visible curvature source must carry nonzero `alpha_1` second Chern
class.

# Role-Separation Theorem

The printed monad alone cannot be the selected visible alpha_1 source:

```text
c2(E_monad) = 0,
c2(V_visible target) = +4 alpha_1.
```

These are different topological classes.  Therefore:

```text
three-family monad alone != visible alpha_1 Chern-Weil source.
```

# What Remains Possible

The monad can still be used in its proper lane:

```text
matter/zero-mode source, if typed maps and cohomology representatives are supplied.
```

The visible curvature source must come from one of:

```text
selected nonabelian stable bundle/sheaf with c2=+4 alpha_1,
selected Route-C HYM/Strominger solve for the trace row,
larger visible bundle whose total c2=+4 alpha_1 is explicitly recomputed.
```

The larger-bundle option is not a free patch.  It must recompute:

```text
total Chern classes,
selected zero-mode basis,
sector projectors,
D_E,
dotD_alpha1,
Riesz/Green,
primitive C1 contractions.
```

# Consequence

This closes a credibility guardrail:

```text
do not reuse the c2=0 monad as the c2=4 alpha_1 visible source.
```

The next source theorem must either build a separate selected visible source or
build an enlarged selected source and derive every downstream operator datum
from that same source.
