# MTT Selected MinimizerTraceC1PayloadTheorem or QuadratureTableValues v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_MINIMIZERTRACE_C1_PAYLOAD_OR_QUADRATURE_VALUES_CONTRACT_BUILT_OPEN`.

This gate turns the open I10 statement into exact executable payload requirements.

Closed now:

```text
I10 payload certificate schema fixed        = True
independent quadrature value tables staged  = True
dual-route acceptance manifest built        = True
observed constants excluded as selectors    = True
```

Still open:

```text
selected minimizer trace payload verified   = False
selected C1 response payload verified       = False
defect-functional minimizer payload verified= False
independent quadrature values filled        = False
unpatched dynamic closure                   = False
```

The two legal routes are now:

```text
Route A: prove the I10 payload certificate from selected minimizer trace + C1 response.
Route B: fill the independent quadrature tables and pass rank/solve/error checks.
```

Replay target if either route is accepted:

```text
A^T A      = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b      = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0]
```
