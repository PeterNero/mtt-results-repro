# MTT Selected StrictPhaseAntisymmetryScalarDerivation or NoKnobYukawaExactness v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_STRICTPHASEANTISYMMETRYSCALARDERIVATION_BUILT_SCALAR_SOURCE_CLOSED_YUKAWA_EXACTNESS_OPEN`

## Scalar Source Theorem

The selected q79 retarded branch gives `q64=15`.  The same-source dynamic
matter/overlap packet, charged retarded-overlap family selector, charged
HYM/Strominger overlap rows, static matter-slot readout, and selected sector
transport put `u,e` on the shared central-circle phase leg.  The charged-lepton
transpose slot fixes the antisymmetric sign, and the selected finite HYM
projection supplies

`s_beta = 0.004701083905943647`.

The phase/transpose comparison uses the q64 retarded denominator and the one
central-circle endpoint unit, so the scalar is

`delta_c2 = -((q64+1)/q64) * s_beta = -0.005014489499673223`.

Thus the prior fitted `c2_u-c2_e` is retired as a source input.

## Replay

The residual-operator coefficient is

`epsilon_theta * s_beta * delta_c2 = -4.402222824618228e-08`.

Executing it on `[27,6,26] outer Q=[-2,3,-1]` leaves:

- max log residual: `7.959463247076742e-09`
- worst multiplicative Yukawa error:
  `1.0000000079594633`

The bounded-error certificate below `8e-9` remains accepted.

## Decision

Closed now:

- strict source derivation of the q64/s_beta phase-antisymmetry scalar,
- retirement of fitted `c2_u-c2_e` as a source value,
- retained ultra-tight bounded-error replay certificate.

Still open:

- exact zero-residual Yukawa replay,
- a theorem explaining the remaining `~8e-9` replay residual as exact finite
  arithmetic or a stronger exactness class,
- full no-knob SM equivalence.
