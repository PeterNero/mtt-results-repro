# Selected `Qa/SU3` Automorphy Factor Constraint Solver

The section-ring route has now been refined.  The required charges are mixed in
the three line-bundle directions `(a,b,c)`, so several tempting shortcuts cannot
close the packet:

```text
flat characters: reject
base-torus Appell-Humbert pullback: partial only
central fiber theta factor: partial only
```

The live ordinary route is therefore a full nil-theta automorphy factor on the
complex Heisenberg quotient.  It must use the nonabelian group law, not only the
abelianized base torus.

The live unconventional route is the projective gerbe / twisted factor route.
It becomes relevant if ordinary line-bundle factors are too small and the true
selected packet is a twisted module or projective Chan-Paton object.

## Next Equations

The next artifact should write:

```text
a_q(gamma,z) = exp(2*pi*i*Phi_q(gamma,z))
```

and impose:

```text
Phi_q(gamma1 gamma2,z)
= Phi_q(gamma1,gamma2.z) + Phi_q(gamma2,z) mod Z.
```

Then it must compute the induced Chern cocycle and prove it equals the desired
charge `q=(a,b,c)`.
