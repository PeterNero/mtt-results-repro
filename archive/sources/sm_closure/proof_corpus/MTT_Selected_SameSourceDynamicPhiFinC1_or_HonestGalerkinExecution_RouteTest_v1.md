# MTT Selected SameSourceDynamicPhiFinC1 or HonestGalerkinExecution RouteTest v1

Active label: `PSM-C1-01`.

Active route: `ROUTE-A`.

Sidecar label: `PSM-C1-04`.

This artifact tests whether the same-source dynamic `Phi_fin^C1` source rule
already closes `PSM-C1-01`. It does not.

What is now sharp:

- the source-rule contract exists
- canonical `Q_residual` support is selected
- exact conditional replay gives rank 2 and `deltaTheta_C1=[1,1]`
- stationary transport and fixed-fiber shortcuts are ruled out
- physical differentiated application, phase/shift residual sources, and
  `b_selected` are not emitted

`ROUTE-B` remains a valid replacement lane, but it is not ready: selected
zero-mode bases, primitive 3x3 terms, linear response matrices, and
C33/nonzero-family-rank rows are still missing.

Next labels:

- primary: `PSM-C1-01`
- sidecar: `PSM-C1-04`
- replacement readiness: `PSM-C1-02` through `ROUTE-B`
