# MTT Selected PhysicalC1ActionIdentity or SameSourceBSelectedEmission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHYSICALC1ACTIONIDENTITY_OR_SAMESOURCEBSELECTEDEMISSION_BUILT_EQUIVALENCE_PROMOTION_OPEN`.

This gate fixes the exact remaining equivalence:

```text
finite trace boundary closed          = True
trace/Frobenius formal support        = True
conditional R_Z/R_X source map ready  = True
b_selected replay available           = True
same-source b_selected emitted        = False
physical action identity promoted     = False
```

The proof now says: the dynamic C1 packet closes by Route A exactly when the
physical `Phi_fin^C1` action emits the same-source source packet
`(R_Z, R_X, b_selected)` under the selected physical trace measure and with no
extra physical boundary/source term. Otherwise Route B must replace it with an
honest selected Galerkin/quadrature value run.

No observed masses, mixings, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target residuals
are used as selectors.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PhysicalActionSourceEmission_or_HonestGalerkinReplacement_v1`.
