# Selected Flat FP Quotient Normalization Policy v1

## Purpose

This note closes the remaining SU2 quotient-policy gate for weak-split
gauge-kinetic threshold accounting.

It decides whether the flat adjoint Faddeev-Popov determinant should be kept
as a finite threshold contribution.

## Scope

This is closed for weak-split gauge-kinetic threshold accounting.

It is not a claim about vacuum energy, absolute partition-function
normalization, or non-flat ghost determinants.

## Source Policy

The gauge-fixing source identifies the Faddeev-Popov determinant as the
projection Jacobian for the gauge quotient.  Ghosts are quotient-measure
bookkeeping variables.

For abelian Qc, the field-independent FP determinant already decouples from
weak-split accounting.  The same rule applies to any field-independent flat FP
determinant when the target observable is a gauge-kinetic threshold coefficient:

```text
field-independent quotient Jacobian -> representative-measure normalization,
not a gauge-kinetic threshold term.
```

## SU2 Application

The selected SU2 threshold background is flat:

```text
M_G[A] -> -Delta_0 tensor ad(SU2).
```

The raw flat adjoint determinant would be:

```text
3 p_scalar = -1.7942911767477328.
```

But this term carries no selected gauge-curvature insertion.  It changes only
the orbit-volume/representative-measure normalization in this weak-split gate.

Therefore:

```text
extra FP threshold term = 0.
```

The selected SU2 weak-split gauge block is:

```text
p_SU2 = -1.1961941178318218.
```

## Verdict

The flat FP quotient-normalization policy is closed for weak-split accounting.

SU2 may now be carried as selected for `lambda_12` accounting, within the same
scope as Qc:

```text
selected p_SU2 = C_A(SU2) p_scalar,
flat adjoint FP determinant discarded/absorbed as quotient normalization.
```

This does not certify the full electroweak prediction, because Qa/SU3-Nil and
the full selected physical quotient remain open.
