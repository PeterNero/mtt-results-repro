# Dynamic C1 Breakthrough Attempt: Axiom or Galerkin Decision v1

Status: `BREAKTHROUGH_CONDITIONAL_AXIOM_READY_STRICT_UNPATCHED_OPEN`

This artifact records the deepest current breakthrough attempt at the dynamic
C1 wall.

## Result

The wall is not static source provenance anymore.  Static enriched Weyl-pair
provenance is closed, and the dynamic C1 transfer tensor has an exact
conditional normal form:

- `A^T A = 12 I_2`;
- `A^T b = (12, 12)`;
- `deltaTheta_C1 = (1, 1)`;
- rank `2`;
- condition number `1`.

The remaining obstruction is the selected dynamic value-emission rule.

## Breakthrough Lane A

The corpus now has an insertion-ready rule:

`DifferentiatedPhiFinC1ResidualProjectorAxiom`

It says that, on the selected `q79/F,m=1 S3/GS Route-C` branch, the physical
differentiated `Phi_fin^C1` action applies the canonical residual projector
`Q_residual` to the selected enriched Weyl source packet.

If accepted or proved, this axiom emits:

- selected phase residual `R_Z`;
- selected shift residual `R_X`;
- same-branch Hessian/source vector `b_selected`;
- same-branch normalization;
- the selected dynamic C1 packet.

This closes SM-parity dynamic C1 under the explicit local/principle tier.

## Strict Status

The axiom is not yet derived from unpatched physical action text.  It is not
currently inserted as an accepted main-corpus axiom in this local corrected
chain.

Therefore strict unpatched/no-knob closure remains open.

## Breakthrough Lane B

The honest-Galerkin lane remains legal.  To close without the axiom, emit:

1. zero-mode basis packet;
2. primitive contraction terms;
3. Hessian/source vector packet;
4. sector response matrices;
5. exactness/error certificates;
6. proof that these values are selected before residual-projector replay.

## Decision

The closest available breakthrough is not another numerical search.  It is a
principle decision:

- accept/insert `DifferentiatedPhiFinC1ResidualProjectorAxiom` and mark dynamic
  C1 closed under local/principle tier; or
- derive that axiom from unpatched `Theta/Phi_fin/Strominger` action text; or
- execute the honest Galerkin C1 lane.
