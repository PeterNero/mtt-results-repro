Status:
`SELECTED_LORENTZIAN_COFRAME_AND_CAUSAL_REPRESENTATIVE_CLOSED_AFTER_A_QG_AND_ONE_BINARY_CAUSAL_BOUNDARY_MARK`

## Scope

This theorem composes already certified results. It closes the existence,
soldering, representative-neutrality and causal-representative rows at the
adopted minimal-data tier. It does not derive a time orientation, an arrow of
time, a cosmic state, Newton's constant or the cosmological constant.

Use the two declarations

```text
A_QG:
  select the gauge class of the canonical q79/Z64/Q_WW
  minimal-full-monodromy-rootstack Lorentzian realization;

A_causal:
  choose one of its two time orientations and the associated retarded
  boundary class.
```

`A_QG` is the already counted discrete physical-realization axiom. `A_causal`
is one binary boundary mark. Neither introduces a continuous coupling or uses
an observed value.

## Theorem

Assume `A_QG`, `A_causal`, the selected invertible global comparison field
`Q_WW`, and the strict same-source rule that the gravitational action factors
through its metric observable

```text
G = Q_WW^T Q_WW.
```

Then the selected realization admits a global Lorentzian coframe whose spatial
solder form is induced by `Q_WW`; all fixed-metric teleparallel
representatives are gauge or boundary equivalent at the declared
two-derivative bulk tier; no independent frame mode survives; and the
retarded representative of the conjugate finite pair is q79/F. Reversing the
time orientation exchanges the retarded and advanced representatives and
retains q369/F* as the conjugate partner.

## Proof

The canonical physical realization is globally hyperbolic and time-orientable.
The smooth splitting theorem therefore supplies

```text
Y4 diffeomorphic to R x Sigma3
```

for a smooth spacelike Cauchy hypersurface `Sigma3`. Every orientable smooth
three-manifold is parallelizable. Hence `T Sigma3` is trivial, and adjoining
the nonvanishing temporal line makes `T Y4` trivial. A global Lorentzian
coframe exists.

Strict same-source support typing identifies the world-in-world base with an
oriented Cauchy support and sets `TP=T Sigma3`, up to diffeomorphism. The
selected field

```text
Q_WW: T Sigma3 -> TI
```

is an invertible global bundle map with the certified bi-frame transition law.
It is therefore exactly a spatial solder form and identifies `TI` with the
internal spatial frame bundle. In an adapted splitting the coframe is

```text
theta^0 = N dt,
theta^a = Q_WW^a_i (dx^i + N^i dt).
```

The certified symbolic identities give the ADM metric and volume exactly.
Lapse and shift are multiplier or gauge fields, not fit parameters. Different
Cauchy charts and local Lorentz frames are diffeomorphism and frame gauge.

Making a chosen global frame parallel constructs a flat metric-compatible
teleparallel connection. Its torsion is exactly coframe anholonomy. The
selected source packet contains symmetric strain but no skew orientation
coordinate. Foundation's autonomous-descent criterion then makes a strict
same-source bulk law constant on the `SO(3)` orientation fibers of
`Q -> Q^T Q`. The exact pure-frame symbol has the two constraints

```text
2 c1 + c2 + c3 = 0,
-4 c1 + 2 c2 = 0,
```

whose unique ray is

```text
(c1,c2,c3) proportional to (1/4,1/2,-1).
```

Thus the action is TEGR at this order. The TEGR/Einstein boundary identity
proves nonlinear metric descent, so no extra bulk frame mode or independent
inertial-connection mode remains.

Finally `A_causal` supplies the orientation and retarded boundary class that
`A_QG` cannot distinguish. The exact finite branch certificate then selects
q79/F, with residues `(15 mod 64, 2 mod 7)`. The opposite orientation exchanges
retarded with advanced support and carries q369/F*, whose residues `(49,5)`
are additive negatives modulo `64` and `7`; `79+369=0 mod 448`. No observed CP
sign or flavor datum enters this selection.

This proves the composition.

## Parameter ledger

```text
inherited A_QG declarations:             1 discrete
new A_causal declarations:               1 binary boundary mark
new continuous parameters in this step:  0
observed values used as selectors:        0
physical coframe orientation coordinates:0
lapse/shift fit parameters:               0
```

The independent two-derivative gravity coordinates `kappa_h` (or `G_eff`) and
`Lambda_eff` remain under the gravity-normalization blocker. A unique cosmic
state, low-entropy condition and thermodynamic arrow remain state-selection
questions. Higher-derivative and quantum/UV rows also remain open.

## Guardrail

This theorem says that a causal representative is selected after one binary
causal boundary mark. It does not say that MTT derives which time orientation
we observe, that both orientations are simultaneously observed, or that causal
orientation explains the thermodynamic arrow.
