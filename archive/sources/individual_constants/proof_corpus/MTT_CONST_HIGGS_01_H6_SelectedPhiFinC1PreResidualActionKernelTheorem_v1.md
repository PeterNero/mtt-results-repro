# MTT CONST HIGGS 01 H6 Selected PhiFinC1 PreResidual Action Kernel Theorem v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_HIGGS_01_H6_LOCAL_PRERESIDUAL_KERNEL_CLOSED_UNPATCHED_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-HIGGS-01 / HIGGS-QUARTIC-THRESHOLD / H6-SELECTED-PHIFINC1-PRERESIDUAL-ACTION-KERNEL-THEOREM`

## Result

```text
local pre-residual action kernel closed          True
strict kernel validator ok                       True
unpatched theorem derived                        False
independent kernel execution                     False
actual nonlinear Higgs source rows emitted       False
Higgs quartic numeric value                      False
strict no-knob Higgs closure                     False
```

## Meaning

H6 closes the source-ownership object only in the local-premise tier:

```text
accepted local SelectedWeylVariationActionPrinciple
  => selected Phi_fin^C1 pre-residual action kernel
  => SI-1c validator passes inside the local proof spine
```

This is progress, but it is not unpatched/no-knob closure.

## Higgs Consequence

Together with H5B, the local tier now has:

```text
source-ownership premise: local closed
Higgs coordinate: [12]
future quartic row address: [12,12,12,12]
```

But H6 does not emit an actual H-sector fourth-variation row.  So `lambda_H`
is still not derived.
