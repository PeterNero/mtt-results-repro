# MTT Selected WZHElectroweakRows or SelectedRThetaMassSchemeDerivation v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_WZHELECTROWEAKROWS_OR_SELECTEDRTHETAMASSSCHEMEDERIVATION_BUILT_EXTERNAL_BENCHMARK_ROWS_CLOSED_COVARIANCE_RTHETA_OPEN`.

This artifact closes the W/Z/H electroweak matching coordinate layer at the
external benchmark/reference tier.

```text
accepted W/Z/H coordinate rows : 5
rows                            : v(G_F), g_Y(M_t), g_1^GUT(M_t), g_2(M_t), lambda(M_t)
selected R_theta rows closed    : false
full covariance/profile closed  : false
true SM equivalence closed      : false
no-knob closure                 : false
```

The row layer is now usable as a validation target for selected `R_theta`
derivations, but it is not itself the selected source derivation.

The Higgs decay electroweak rows are kept separate: WW*, ZZ*, and Zgamma remain
downstream benchmark replay rows until formula kernels or an official likelihood
with covariance are imported.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_FullCovarianceProfile_or_SelectedRThetaSourceRows_v1`.
