# Selected Aint Packet Branch Bridge Audit v1

## Result

There are two useful internal gap branches, but they cannot be silently
identified.

```text
Theta nil floor: lambda_* = 0.25, sqrt(lambda_*) = 0.5, tau0 = 4
Z64 exact branch: lambda_* = 15, sqrt(lambda_*) = 3.872983346207417, tau0 = 1/15
```

The QG packet has the form:

```text
A_int = kappa_1 Delta_B1 + kappa_2 Delta_B2 + kappa_3 Delta_B3
lambda_* = min_n kappa_n lambda_{n,*}
```

## What Transfers

The QG operator shape transfers.

The Theta nil floor transfers as a conservative internal floor and as a
benchmark where the nil sector saturates `0.25`.

The Z64 value `lambda_* = 15` transfers as a normalized exact-branch damping
value in internal action units.

## What Does Not Transfer Yet

The Z64 value cannot be declared the GR/QG modal gap until a branch bridge proves
that the selected GR `A_int` noncoherent complement is the same exact
central-circle tower block.

Likewise, the nil floor cannot be declared universal selected saturation because
Theta I explicitly says explicit nil realizations may exceed the bound and need
not saturate it.

## Missing Theorem

`Selected_Aint_Branch_Bridge_Theorem` must identify:

- which branch supplies the GR/QG `A_int` operator
- the selected `kappa_1,kappa_2,kappa_3`
- the selected fiber eigenvalues after quotienting zero modes
- whether the selected gap is `0.25`, `15`, or another value
- why no cross-branch normalization substitution is being made
