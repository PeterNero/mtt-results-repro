# MTT Selected FullCovarianceProfile or SelectedRThetaSourceRows v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FULLCOVARIANCEPROFILE_OR_SELECTEDRTHETASOURCEROWS_BUILT_BLOCK_COVERAGE_FULL_COVARIANCE_AND_SOURCE_ROWS_OPEN`.

This artifact assembles the post-W/Z/H, post-BCT coverage matrix.

```text
external value layer broadly populated : true
block coverage matrix closed           : true
full covariance/profile closed         : false
selected R_theta source rows closed    : false
true SM equivalence closed             : false
no-knob closure                        : false
```

The useful result is that the value layer is no longer the vague blocker. The
remaining wall is now precise: fill covariance sidecars/cross-block covariance,
or derive selected `R_theta` source rows for `v/gY/g2/lambda` and the BCT
mass-scheme rows.
