# MTT Selected BottomCharmTauRunDecReplay or RThetaMassSchemeRows v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_BOTTOMCHARMTAURUNDECREPLAY_OR_RTHETAMASSSCHEMEROWS_BUILT_BC_CRUNDEC_ROWS_TAU_RTHETA_OPEN`.

This artifact executes a versioned CRunDec replay for the b/c quark MSbar
native-scale-to-`M_Z` transport rows.

```text
accepted external b/c/tau rows : 2
bottom RunDec/CRunDec row      : closed
charm RunDec/CRunDec row       : closed
tau QED/EW running row         : open
selected Rtheta derivation     : open
```

The important correction is that the old first-pass common-scale b/c rows are
now explicitly superseded as physical `M_Z` quark transport rows: CRunDec
decreases both running masses at `M_Z`, while the legacy proxy increased them.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_TauEWRunningPolicy_or_RThetaMassSchemeRows_v1`.
