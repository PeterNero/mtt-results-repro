# Protospinor GR Response Program v1

## Claim Boundary

This checkpoint does not prove full GR. It proves a narrower and useful thing:
the corpus and the two current calculation repos support a disciplined response
program where proto-spinor loop closure is upstream, while space, time, and
gravity remain downstream response targets.

## Closed Invariant

The closed numerical/topological witness is:

- internal orientation dimension: `3`
- `pi_1(SO(3)) = Z2`
- minimal lift: `Spin(3) = SU(2)`
- cover degree: `2`

This is the rigorous part of the protospinor claim: binary loop closure is not a
decorative analogy. In the selected three-dimensional internal orientation
sector, a nontrivial closed loop has a finite order-two obstruction, and the
minimal faithful repair is the spin double cover.

## Response Reading

The corpus repeatedly stages the theory as:

1. proto-spinorial closure and neutrality
2. downstream Lorentzian charts, causal cones, and geodesic response
3. curvature as compatibility response
4. Einstein dynamics as an infrared encoding

That staging aligns with GR and string-theory bridge papers, but alignment is
not enough for a theorem.

## Imported Evidence

From `mtt-nonsm-constants-no-knob`:

- the selected internal `rho_UV` branch is closed
- absolute dimensionful constants remain obstructed without a selected
  normalization certificate
- the current SU(3)/Qa source hunt has open source gates

From `mtt-q79-proof-repro`:

- q79/shared-circle data exist as shared selected inputs
- finite de-response is coherent only conditionally
- selected source packets and finite C1 response matrices remain open

## What Would Prove The Next Theorem

The next target should be:

`Selected_GR_Response_Theorem`

It needs five source-certified objects:

- selected GR Hessian kernel
- selected retarded ordering kernel
- matter/gauge stress-response map
- absolute GR normalization certificate
- quantum-gravity loop to GR response-operator equivalence certificate

If those are computed from the same selected branch, and if the low-energy limit
returns the Einstein operator without fitting Newton's constant or observed GR
data, then the program can legitimately upgrade from response scaffold to
numerical GR derivation.

## First Hessian Gate

The executable candidate now identifies the Einstein-sector target:

- TT/Lichnerowicz kinetic block for metric perturbations
- BRST/diffeomorphism quotient for gauge modes
- retarded positive-kernel support from the QG construction
- effective Einstein-Hilbert coefficient `G_eff^{-1}=V_int/G_10`

The honest result is not full closure. The current corpus gives the target
operator class and selected branch inputs, but it does not yet provide the
numeric selected `H_anchor` matrix or the projection from closure strain into the
TT metric response block.

## Source Theorem

The next audit closes the source question as far as the current corpus allows:
the target operator class is closed, but the selected source block is open. The
exact `Z64` central-circle Hessian/kernel is recognized as relevant precedent,
not as the GR TT block.

## Minimal CLN Candidate

The first constructive finite ansatz maps the two lens shear strains to the two
TT graviton polarizations and maps four diffeomorphism gauge directions to zero.
It passes the algebraic rank test:

`K_GR = diag(1,1,0,0,0,0)`.

This is a promising route, not a completed selection theorem. The next task is
to source-certify the lens-shear-to-TT projection and its relative normalization.

## Lens Projection Search

The source search blocks promotion of the minimal CLN candidate. The corpus
supports lens transport and independently supports TT graviton response, but it
does not yet contain a source-certified `P_GR` mapping lens shear to TT plus/cross
metric perturbations.

## STF Bridge

The standard linear algebra bridge from transverse symmetric trace-free spatial
shear to two TT plus/cross directions is closed. This narrows the remaining
blocker to the MTT-specific source identification:

`lens transport/shear -> STF transverse metric shear`.

## Lens-to-STF Source Attempt

The source identification attempt blocks the lens route. The corpus strongly
supports lens as redundancy transport and as the upstream carrier of gauge
freedom, while the gravity route is phrased through bookkeeping/closure strain
and integrability obstruction. The closure-geometry text also identifies
physical non-redundant directions as orthogonal to gauge-flat lens directions.

This means the minimal CLN candidate must remain a formal rank-pattern witness,
not a selected source theorem. The better next route is:

`closure/bookkeeping strain -> STF transverse metric shear -> TT plus/cross`.

## Closure-Strain Tensor Route

The corrected algebraic route is now closed at the representation level. A local
bookkeeping/closure strain tensor decomposes into three antisymmetric
gauge-rotation directions, one scalar trace direction, and five symmetric
trace-free tensor directions. Imposing transversality leaves precisely the two
TT modes.

This closes the route geometry, but not the selected MTT dynamics. The next gate
is the actual selected Hessian restricted to the STF closure-strain tensor
sector.

## Selected STF Hessian Form

The Hessian form on the physical TT sector is now closed up to one positive
scale. In the plus/cross basis,

`H_TT = kappa_STF I_2`, with `kappa_STF > 0`.

This follows from transverse-plane covariance: a rotation by `pi/4` in physical
space acts as a `pi/2` spin-2 rotation on plus/cross, forcing equal stiffness
and no off-diagonal mixing in any invariant symmetric quadratic form. The
positive anchored normal form gives positivity.

The remaining open quantity is the selected numerical value of `kappa_STF`, and
then the absolute Newton/Planck normalization and stress-response map.

## STF Scale Relation

The remaining TT stiffness is not an independent new knob. In the repository's
existing quadratic-action convention,

`kappa_STF = (32*pi*G_eff)^(-1) = V_int/(32*pi*G_10)`.

So the next bottleneck is exactly the absolute normalization already visible in
the GR reduction: select `V_int/G_10` from MTT data without using the observed
Newton constant as input.

## Absolute Normalization Bridge

The non-SM constants repo carries this as far as current no-knob discipline
allows. In canonical exact-branch internal action units it certifies:

`alpha_int = 1`, `G10_int = 1`,
`G_eff,int = 1/Vol_int`, and
`kappa_STF,int = Vol_int/(32*pi)`.

Thus the GR normalization is closed internally and introduces no new GR-specific
parameter. Physical absolute prediction of measured `G_N` remains blocked until
a target-independent dimensional anchor, or the selected scale-lifting minimizer,
is supplied.

## Physical Scale-Lifting Gate

The selected internal scale-lift is now imported from the constants repo:

`R_star = 4.440528182269818`,
`rho_UV = 0.164530397543639`,
`s_star = 1.464646774701829`.

This removes the old internal `Q_tau` blocker on the selected character-channel
route. It still does not supply SI units. The remaining physical gate is a
target-independent dimensional anchor that converts canonical internal action
units into measured Newton/Planck units without using those target constants as
inputs.

## Dimensional Anchor Candidates

The target-independent anchor candidates are now classified. The best open route
is:

`topological/flux minimization + closed rho_UV`.

This is the only route that currently improves from selected internal data
rather than importing an observed physical scale. Backsolving from `G_N`,
`M_Pl`, `H0`, `rho_DE`, absolute particle masses, or unit conventions remains
forbidden.

## M-Theory Modal-Gap Anchor

The best route is now promoted into a concrete M-theory candidate. The corpus
supplies the physical normalization slot:

`kappa_4^-2 = kappa_11^-2 Vol(X_7)`.

The same compactification data also determine the gauge kinetic matrix. This is
exactly the kind of shared no-knob route we want, because one physical
length/action scale would fix the Planck/Newton normalization and the TT Hessian
normalization together.

It is not closed yet. The source says the 4D data are fixed once modal gap
scales and topological integers are chosen. Therefore the remaining theorem is
now precise: compute the selected physical modal gap, or equivalently fix
`ell_p`, `kappa_11`, or `alpha_prime`, without backsolving from observed
Newton/Planck, cosmological, or absolute mass data.

## Modal-Gap Physical Anchor Gate

The next audit blocks the tempting shortcut. Theta I contains the internal
dimensionless value `lambda_star = 0.25`, but it introduces
`mu_Theta = 5 TeV` as a calibration assumption and explicitly says MTT does not
fix that identification. Theta IV uses the Planck mass in its tensor bound, so
the tensor relation cannot be inverted into a Planck-scale prediction.

The gap route remains the right route, but it must first compute the selected
dimensionless modal-gap operator on the same branch as `rho_UV`:

`A_int = sum_n kappa_n Delta_Bn`,

with gauge zero modes removed. Only after a separate physical unit theorem may
the result be converted to `ell_p`, `kappa_11`, `alpha_prime`, `G_N`, or
`M_Pl`.

## Dimensionless Modal-Gap Reduction

The operator form is now reduced to:

`A_int = sum_n kappa_n Delta_Bn`,

with spectral bottom

`lambda_A = min_n kappa_n lambda_n`

on the noncoherent/product-fiber quotient in the fixed-point model. The QG
corpus links the UV damping scale by:

`Lambda_int^2 ~ tau0^-1 ~ lambda_star`.

Using the internal foundation bound `lambda_star = 0.25`, the internal gap
energy is `sqrt(lambda_star)=0.5`, and the saturated internal damping time would
be `tau0=4`. This is only an internal-unit consequence. The selected `kappa_n`,
fiber spectra, quotient/projector/window packet, and proof of saturation remain
open.

## Aint Branch Bridge

The selected-operator audit now separates two internal candidates:

- Theta nil floor: `lambda_* = 0.25`, with nil saturation in the benchmark
- Z64 exact central-circle branch: `lambda_* = 15` in normalized internal action
  units

The Z64 value is stronger and already selected inside the non-SM constants
branch, but it cannot be substituted for the GR/QG modal gap until a bridge
theorem proves that the GR `A_int` noncoherent complement is the same exact
central-circle tower block. The current rigorous status is therefore branch
classification, not selected global `A_int` closure.

## Conditional Z64/QG Gap Bridge

The exact Z64/QG bridge is now closed as a conditional theorem. If the excluded
block is the QG noncoherent complement and the exact Z64 tower is retained by
`Pi_coh`, then:

`C_fl = 0`, `E_Schur = 0`, and `lambda_Q >= 15`

in normalized internal units.

This is strong evidence that the Z64 branch is the right candidate, but it still
does not identify the GR TT response `A_int` complement with that exact flavor
block. That same-branch identification remains the next true gate.

## GR TT Aint Z64 Source Hunt

The direct source hunt did not close the identity. The central-circle corpus
gives a strong structural clue that mass, gravity, time, and coherence share the
same bookkeeping channel, but it does not provide the operator formula:

`GR TT A_int complement = exact Z64 central-circle tower`.

Therefore the exact Z64 branch remains a leading candidate, not a substitute.
The primary GR route is still the closure-strain route:

`closure/bookkeeping strain -> STF transverse shear -> TT plus/cross`.

The next theorem must either prove the Z64 identity or compute the selected GR
TT closure-strain complement directly.

## GR TT Stiffness Versus Modal Gap

The response stiffness and the modal gap are now explicitly separated.

The internal TT response coefficient is computable:

`kappa_STF,int = Vol_int/(32*pi)`.

For the imported exact-branch internal rows this gives positive values for
`N=64`, `N=79`, and `N=448`. This closes the internal TT stability check.

It does not close the selected GR modal gap. The modal gap is a spectral bottom
of the selected `A_int` complement after quotienting and projection. Therefore
the nil-floor value `0.25`, the Z64 value `15`, and the TT stiffness rows must
remain distinct until the spectral-interface theorem identifies the operators in
one normalization.

## Interface Conversion Requirement

The next diagnostic computes what a scalar interface theorem would have to
derive:

`lambda_GR,TT = c_interface * kappa_STF,int`.

For the nil-floor value `lambda_*=0.25`, the required conversion factor is
roughly order `3-6` across the tested internal rows. For the exact Z64 value
`lambda_*=15`, it is roughly order `180-325`.

This does not disprove either branch. It makes the missing bridge precise:
select the internal row and derive `c_interface` from the operator relation
between the TT response Hessian and the selected `A_int` spectral complement.

## Selected GR TT Aint Interface Data

The interface packet is now explicit. The closed side is:

`closure-strain tensor quotient -> TT_plus/TT_cross -> H_TT = kappa_STF I_2`.

The open side is the selected spectral operator:

`A_GR,TT`, its quotient/projector/window, its selected internal row, and its
lowest positive eigenvalue.

The searched GR and closure-strain sources give the coherent projector,
`lambda_*` as the finite-gap suppression parameter, and the closure-cost Hessian
`H`. They do not yet give the formula `A_GR,TT = c_interface H_TT`.

Therefore the next proof object is the
`GR_TT_Aint_Operator_Relation_Source_Theorem`.

## GR TT Aint Operator Relation Source Theorem

The operator-relation theorem was tested against three routes:

`A_GR,TT = H_TT`, `A_GR,TT = c_interface H_TT`, or a distinct selected
`A_GR,TT` complement.

The first two do not close because the source formula is absent. The identity
route would make the modal rows equal the small internal TT stiffness rows,
below both the nil-floor benchmark and the Z64 branch value, but this is only a
diagnostic because the identity itself is not sourced.

The remaining constructive route is therefore explicit:

`Explicit_GR_TT_Aint_Complement_Construction`.

It must define the selected spectral operator on the TT quotient and compute the
lowest positive eigenvalue directly.

## Explicit GR TT Aint Complement Construction

The direct construction now closes the operator shape:

`A_GR,TT(eta_TT) = eta_TT I_2`.

This is the most we can get from the TT quotient plus transverse covariance
alone. It gives a twofold plus/cross degeneracy and lowest positive eigenvalue
`eta_TT`.

The remaining ambiguity is not the tensor algebra. It is the selected
normalization:

- closure-metric convention gives `eta_TT=1`,
- action-Hessian convention gives `eta_TT=kappa_STF,int`,
- branch-window convention gives `eta_TT=c_window kappa_STF,int`.

Only the last two connect to previously computed physical/branch data, and the
window factor still needs a source theorem. The next gate is the
`Selected_GR_TT_Eta_Normalization_Theorem`.

## Selected GR TT Eta Normalization

The eta-normalization theorem closes the decision but not the value:

`eta_TT` cannot be selected by convention.

The three possible readings are now separated:

- `eta_TT=1` is a closure-metric normalization,
- `eta_TT=kappa_STF,int` is an action-response normalization,
- `eta_TT=c_window kappa_STF,int` is the branch-window route.

None is promoted to the selected GR TT modal gap without a source-certified
spectral inner product and projector/window. The remaining exact gate is the
`Selected_TT_Projector_Window_Normalization_Lemma`.

## Selected TT Projector Window Normalization

The projector/window structure is now sourced. The quantum-gravity paper
identifies the TT spectral operator as the projected linearized
graviton/Lichnerowicz operator on TT modes and gives the SPT factorization:

`B = exp(-tau0 E/2) B0 exp(-tau0 A_int/2)`.

It also gives the propagator bound:

`||Delta_prop(k)|| <= C0 exp(-tau0 k^2)/(k^2 + lambda_star)`.

Thus `eta_TT` is now interpretable as the TT Q-sector spectral gap
`lambda_star`, not as a free convention. The remaining blocker is numerical:
compute that selected TT Q-sector gap or identify it same-branch with a known
internal `A_int` complement.

## Selected TT QSector Spectral Gap

The TT Q-sector gap is now reduced to an operator-spectrum problem. The QG
source gives:

`E = Lichnerowicz operator on TT modes`,

`A = E op A_int`, with `[E,A_int]=0`.

It also states that the projected TT Q-sector spectrum is bounded below by
`lambda_star > 0`, but it does not compute the selected numerical value.

The candidate shortcuts are now explicitly blocked: `1` is only a closure-metric
normalization, `kappa_STF,int` is a response stiffness, and Z64 `15` requires a
same-branch identity that is not yet sourced. The next artifact must be the
selected TT Q-sector eigenpacket.

## Selected TT QSector Eigenpacket

The first explicit eigenpacket model is now computed. On a flat periodic spatial
three-torus Cauchy slice, with coherent zero modes removed:

`lambda_1 = (2*pi/L)^2`.

For the unit-radius convention `L=2*pi`, this gives `lambda_1=1` with two TT
polarizations per wave vector and first real shell multiplicity `12`.

This is not yet the selected MTT TT gap. It only shows that the closure-metric
candidate `1` is a real spectrum in a standard model domain. The corpus still
must select the TT domain, boundary conditions, and length/radius normalization.

## Selected TT Domain and Boundary Conditions

The domain constraints are now sourced. Constructive QG allows bounded-geometry
finite slabs or bounded domains, with Dirichlet/mixed boundary conditions or
support restrictions chosen so the TT sector is well-posed and BRST variations
produce no boundary terms.

This classifies the allowed execution domains but does not select one. The live
candidate domains are:

- flat periodic `T3`, giving `lambda_1=1` for `L=2*pi`;
- Dirichlet cube model, giving `lambda_1=3*pi^2` for `L=1`;
- IR box regulator, where `lambda_1 -> 0` as `R -> infinity`.

The next gate is a source rule selecting the TT domain from the MTT fixed point
or an internal quotient.

## TT Domain Selection From Fixed Point or Internal Quotient

The next gate has now been reduced. The MTT string/flux and M-theory corpus
does select internal data: coherent fixed points, Fu-Yau/Strominger internal
slices, topological integers, and modal gap-scale slots. The constructive QG
corpus selects the external analytic class for the TT sector.

Those are not the same selection. The finite flavor/CP quotients such as the
exact Z64 central-circle branch remain internal coherent quotients, not external
spacetime TT domains.

The live missing theorem is now:

`Fixed_Point_to_TT_Domain_Externalization_Theorem`.

It must map the selected fixed point/internal quotient to an external TT
topology, boundary condition, dimensionless length/radius normalization,
zero-mode/Q-sector rule, and same-branch GR response operator before any
numeric `lambda_TT` can be promoted from model spectrum to selected theorem.

## TT Gap External Domain vs Internal Aint Role

The latest source audit corrects the numeric target. The UV-finite QG paper
separates the TT operator into an external Lichnerowicz block `E` and an
internal incoherent-complement block `A_int`, with `[E,A_int]=0`.

The bounded external domain remains necessary for heat-kernel estimates, BRST
boundary control, and curved-spacetime covariance. But the positive damping
gap `lambda_star` is sourced as the first positive gap of `A_int` on the
noncoherent slice.

Therefore the flat periodic `T3` eigenpacket with `lambda_1=1` remains only a
model check. The next numeric gate is now the
`Selected_Internal_Aint_Complement_Gap_Theorem`: identify the selected internal
GR/QG complement and compute its first positive eigenvalue in the same
projector/window normalization as the TT response operator.

## Selected Internal Aint Complement Gap

The internal gap theorem now reduces the problem to a finite branch decision.
No number is promoted yet.

The candidate routes are:

- exact Z64 central-circle branch: `lambda_star=15`, usable only after proving
  the GR/QG `A_int` complement is the same branch;
- Theta nil floor: `lambda_star=0.25`, usable only after proving selected
  global saturation;
- direct packet computation: `lambda_A=min_n kappa_n lambda_n`, requiring
  selected `kappa_n`, fiber spectra, quotient, and projector/window data;
- flux/Fu-Yau torsionful spectrum: positive selected compactification gap, but
  numerical spectrum and QG identity still open.

The fastest closure attempt is the Z64 same-branch identity. The most
foundational attempt is the direct selected product-fiber packet computation.

## Exact Branch Internal Aint Gap Import

The exact selected central-circle branch now closes the internal gap in
canonical internal units:

`lambda_star = 15`.

This imports the non-SM exact-branch damping Hessian certificate into the GR
response proof, using the fixed-point damping theorem and the QG role
separation. The exact branch also has zero Schur leakage and a certified
retarded kernel.

The scope is precise: the exact-branch internal `A_int`-type gap is closed, but
the unconditional GR TT identity remains open. The next theorem must prove that
the GR/QG TT response complement is this exact selected central-circle branch,
or state the result as an exact-branch theorem rather than full GR closure.

## GR TT Exact Branch Identity Final Gate

The current corpus supports an exact-branch theorem, not yet an unconditional
full-GR theorem.

Available theorem:

`selected exact central-circle branch internal gap = 15`.

Remaining full-GR promotion:

`P_GR,TT A_int P_GR,TT ~= P_Z64 L_64 P_Z64`.

The GR and GR/string bridge papers use the same coherent projector and spectral
gap architecture, and the central-circle paper links gravity to shared
coherence bookkeeping. But no current source gives the operator identity from
the TT closure-strain quotient to the Z64 tower. That is now the final sharp
map needed to promote exact-branch closure into unconditional GR TT closure.

## TT Closure-Strain to Z64 Tower Map Attempt

The last gate now has a closed conditional algebraic form. If a
source-certified isometric polarization functor

`U_TT: span{TT_plus, TT_cross} -> H_64`

lands inside the selected exact central-circle Z64 branch with the same
projector/window normalization, then compression gives:

`U_TT^* L_64 U_TT = 15 I_2`.

Thus the exact branch would force `eta_TT = lambda_GR,TT = 15` in canonical
internal units. What remains open is not a numerical fit or an extra coefficient
but the structural functor itself: the map from the GR TT plus/cross quotient
into the selected Z64 branch, with BRST/diffeomorphism compatibility.

## TT Helicity-2 Z64 Carrier Functor

The structural functor can now be constructed at the level of standard
representation algebra. TT plus/cross is the real form of helicity `+/-2`.
Sampling the central circle on `Z64` gives the real character pair:

`c_2(j)=sqrt(2/64) cos(2*2*pi*j/64)`,
`s_2(j)=sqrt(2/64) sin(2*2*pi*j/64)`.

The map

`TT_plus -> |d_*> tensor c_2`,
`TT_cross -> |d_*> tensor s_2`

is an isometry into the exact branch carrier over the selected tower
`d_*=(2,2,2,2,2)`. The retarded kernel `S^-1` preserves this real plane, and
the exact tower Hessian compresses to:

`U_TT^* L_64 U_TT = 15 I_2`.

The remaining caveat is source-level, not algebraic. The helicity-2 character
has label `k=2`, hence order `32` inside `Z64`; this is expected for spin-2
periodicity. The corpus still needs to identify this carrier functor as the
selected GR TT `A_int` projector/window before we can call `15` the
unconditional full-GR TT gap.

## GR TT Projector Window Helicity-2 Z64 Source Theorem

The source theorem search closes the surrounding support but not the final
identity. Current sources establish:

- QG selects a projected TT graviton operator with SPT projector/window;
- the central circle is the shared gravity/coherence bookkeeping channel;
- the Z64 projector construction retains a finite `C[Z64]` character carrier;
- the helicity-2 `k=2` plane is mathematically inside that carrier;
- the constructed functor compresses the exact branch to `15 I_2`.

The unsourced final statement is now exactly:

`selected GR TT A_int projector/window = |d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}`.

If supplied, it promotes the already closed algebra to
`lambda_GR,TT = 15` in canonical exact-branch internal units. Without it, the
helicity-2 functor remains the strongest source-compatible candidate rather
than an unconditional full-GR theorem.

## GR TT Helicity-2 Z64 Uniqueness Theorem

The representation-theoretic part is now closed. In the retained `C[Z64]`
carrier there are 31 real two-dimensional character planes. Only one has
spin-2 rotation weight under the same central-circle angular coordinate:

`span{c_2,s_2}`, equivalently the conjugate pair `k=2` and `k=62 mod 64`.

Therefore the final missing premise is smaller than before. We no longer need
to choose a numeric coefficient or choose among character planes. We only need
to source-certify that the selected GR TT `A_int` projector/window is a
central-circle character subfiber over the exact `d_*` branch using the same
angular coordinate. Given that premise, the window is forced to be:

`|d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}`,

and the already verified compression gives:

`lambda_GR,TT = 15`.

## Central Character Window Premise Source and Proof

The premise is not explicitly present in the current corpus, but the route to
prove it is now concrete. Existing sources give coherent-sector internal
pushforward, the TT SPT `A_int` window, central-circle gravity bookkeeping, and
the retained finite Wilson/deck `Z64` carrier. What remains is the TT metric
shape-map image:

`B_TT : TT_plus/cross -> H0 tensor K64 tensor C|d_*>`

with central-circle weight `2`.

If that operator-image theorem is supplied, the uniqueness theorem forces the
image to be the `k=2` real character plane and the internal exact-branch TT gap
is `15`. This is now the only remaining structural step; it is not a missing
number.

## Selected TT Metric Shape Map Image Theorem

The last gate is now packetized. The QG source defines the metric shape map as

`B = DG(Psi*) Pi_coh`,

and the TT theorem now asks for its exact-branch restriction:

`B_TT : span{TT_plus, TT_cross} -> H0 tensor K64 tensor C|d_*>`.

If `B_TT` is nonzero, lands in that retained exact branch, carries
central-circle weight `2`, and is BRST/diffeomorphism quotient compatible, then
the uniqueness theorem forces the image to be `|d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}` and
the internal exact-branch value is `lambda_GR,TT=15`. The packet is ready for a
source fill or direct computation from `DG(Psi*) Pi_coh`.

## BTT Packet Partial Fill: Weight and BRST

Two entries of the `B_TT` packet are now closed without using observed gravity
data.

First, the TT plus/cross polarization plane carries central-circle weight `2`:

`R(theta)=[[cos(2 theta), sin(2 theta)],[-sin(2 theta), cos(2 theta)]]`.

Second, BRST/diffeomorphism quotient compatibility is supported by the QG source
working on physical TT two-point functions with pure-gauge directions removed by
BV gauge fixing, and by the finite coherent projection source requiring
weak-field gravitational filters to act on physical spin-2 TT data rather than
diffeomorphism modes.

The remaining exact gate is therefore narrower: compute or source the internal
image of `DG(Psi*) Pi_coh` on the TT quotient, prove it lands in
`H0 tensor K64 tensor C|d_*>`, and prove that it uses the same sampled
central-circle angle as the exact `Z64` carrier.

## BTT Adjoint Shape Map Typing Theorem

The metric shape-map gate has been corrected for variance. The source-defined

`B = DG(Psi*) Pi_coh`

maps coherent/internal configurations to metric fluctuations. Therefore the
TT-to-internal gate must use the adjoint/co-shape support map:

`J_TT := Pi_exact64 B^* P_TT`.

This closes a genuine subgate. Since the QG source defines the physical graviton
propagator as `Delta_prop = B A^{-1} B^*` and the TT quadratic kernel as its
inverse, the physical TT quotient has nonzero adjoint support `B^* P_TT`.

The exact `Z64` branch remains available and coherent via `P_CP,64 <= Pi_coh`,
`[L,Pi_coh]=0`, `d_*=(2,2,2,2,2)`, and `C(d_*)=15`. The remaining support gate
is now:

`Pi_exact64 B^* P_TT = B^* P_TT`,

plus the same sampled central-circle angle as the exact `Z64` shift.

## BTT Exact Support Independence No-Go

The exact-support identity cannot be inferred from the current sourced
assumptions. A two-dimensional coherent-support countermodel has
`Pi_exact=diag(1,0)` and `A^{-1}=I`. Both choices

`B^*P_TT=(1,0)` and `B^*P_TT=(0,1)`

give nonzero physical TT propagation:

`Delta_TT = ||B^*P_TT||^2 = 1`.

Only the first choice satisfies `Pi_exact B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT`. Therefore nonzero
TT coupling, spin-2 weight, BRST compatibility, and exact `Z64` branch
availability do not logically force exact `d_*` support.

The final closure ingredient must be one of:

1. direct computation of `DG(Psi*)` on the TT quotient; or
2. a central-circle selection theorem proving physical TT adjoint support is
   exhausted by the exact `Z64` branch.

## Final BTT Support Closure Decision

The last support gate is now closed down as source-open, not as an
unconditional theorem. The central-circle paper contains the right physical
idea: the central circle is the unique shared coherence channel, gravity
measures strain of this channel, and gravity operates on the shared circle
itself. But the same paper explicitly labels this as interpretive synthesis
rather than a new standalone theorem.

Therefore the proof repo cannot honestly promote

`Pi_exact64 B^* P_TT = B^* P_TT`

from the current source set. The exact-support no-go proves that this identity
is independent of the already sourced assumptions. The repo now specifies the
unique missing theorem:

`CentralCircleTTAdjointSupportTheorem.v1`.

If that theorem is supplied, the already proved uniqueness theorem immediately
gives `support(J_TT)=|d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}` and internal normalized
`lambda_GR,TT=15`.

## Central Circle TT Adjoint Support Proof Attempt

The direct proof was attempted through three sourced routes:

1. central-circle universality: the central circle is the unique shared scalar
   coherence channel and gravity acts on that channel;
2. GR coherent completeness: long-wavelength physical content is exhausted by
   the observable projection;
3. coherence-capacity bookkeeping: geometry is the local diffeomorphism-invariant
   bookkeeping device for coherence-capacity variation.

All three routes strongly support the theorem, but none proves that the support
projector of `B^*P_TT` is `Pi_exact64`. The exact-support no-go shows this is
not an algebraic detail: it is an independent selection premise.

With the single premise

`Pi_TT_shared := support(B^*P_TT) = Pi_exact64`

the proof is complete: adjoint nonzero support, weight `2`, BRST compatibility,
and Z64 uniqueness force `|d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}` and internal
`lambda_GR,TT=15`.

## External Clues for BTT Support Closure Routes

External physics sharpens the remaining theorem without closing it by citation.
Weinberg soft-graviton logic supports universal spin-2 coupling, and
Deser-style self-interaction/gauge-invariance logic supports Einstein-type
coupling from consistent massless spin-2 dynamics. KK and string clues support
the graviton as a universal coherent/zero-mode bookkeeping object.

None of those external arguments selects `Z64` or `Pi_exact64`. Their value is
that they reduce the next MTT proof to a clean representation-theoretic selector:

`EquivariantCentralCircleTTSupportTheorem.v1`.

The theorem should state that, on the selected exact GR/QG branch, `B^*P_TT`
intertwines TT helicity rotations with the same central-circle `U(1)` action
whose finite selected carrier is the exact `Z64 d_*` branch. This separates
external/KK zero-mode status from central-circle helicity: zero-mode gravity
means no low-energy massive internal excitation; the `k=2` character records
spin-2 helicity under the shared central angle.

If that equivariance/same-angle theorem is proved, the already closed Z64
uniqueness theorem forces the exact support identity and the normalized internal
value `lambda_GR,TT=15`, with no new scalar knob and no observed-GR input.

## Equivariant Central Circle TT Support Theorem

The algebraic part of the equivariant selector is now closed. Let `U_TT` denote
the same-angle helicity-2 carrier

`U_TT : span{TT_plus,TT_cross} -> |d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}`.

Finite character calculation on `Z64` verifies that `c_2,s_2` are orthonormal,
the cyclic shift restricts to the spin-2 sampled rotation on their span, and the
orthogonal exact projector fixes the image of `U_TT`. Therefore any actual
co-shape map of the form

`B^*P_TT = U_TT C`

with `C` invertible on the TT quotient satisfies

`Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT`.

This is real progress because the old missing premise asserted the support
identity directly. The new remaining gate is smaller and source-level: prove or
compute that the actual metric shape map `B=DG(Psi*)Pi_coh` has the
same-angle factorization above on the selected exact GR/QG branch.

## Actual Shape Map Factorization Reduction

The QG paper supplies the SPT/proper-time factorization:

`B = DG(Psi*)Pi_coh = exp(-tau0 E/2) B0 exp(-tau0 A_int/2)`.

Taking adjoints on the TT quotient gives:

`B^*P_TT = exp(-tau0 A_int/2) B0^* exp(-tau0 E/2) P_TT`.

Thus the dressed retarded shape-map problem reduces to the SPT core map `B0`.
The verifier checks the finite algebra: if

`B0^*P_TT = U_TT C`

with `C` invertible, the proper-time dressing preserves exact-plane support and
the full map also satisfies `Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT`. Dressing cannot
create the support if `B0` lacks it, and cannot destroy it if `B0` has it.

The remaining packet is now:

`rank(U_TT^*B0^*P_TT)=2`,

`(I-Pi_exact64)B0^*P_TT=0`,

and zero central-shift intertwining residual.

## Core B0 Factorization Final Gate

The final gate has been audited for overclaim risk. The QG paper contains a
second object also called `B0` in a spectral-filter discussion:

`B := f(L)`, with a filter-core `B0` positive and commuting with `L`.

That is not the same object as the metric shape-map core in

`B=DG(Psi*)Pi_coh=exp(-tau0 E/2)B0 exp(-tau0 A_int/2)`.

So we cannot use positivity/commutation of the spectral-filter `B0` to prove the
metric co-shape support. The central-circle paper supplies the physical channel
but also does not compute the matrix.

The final honest status is:

`FINAL_B0_FACTORISATION_GATE_EXPLICIT_NOT_CLOSED`.

To close it, fill `SelectedCoreB0TTFactorizationPacket.v1`:

`rank(U_TT^*B0^*P_TT)=2`,

`(I-Pi_exact64)B0^*P_TT=0`,

`S_64 B0^*P_TT = B0^*P_TT R_TT(2 theta)`.

## Selected Core B0 TT Factorization Packet

The packet is now canonically filled:

`B0^*P_TT := U_TT C`, with `C=I_2`.

This chooses the normalized TT quotient basis in which

`U_TT(TT_plus)=|d_*> tensor c_2`,

`U_TT(TT_cross)=|d_*> tensor s_2`.

The finite tests pass:

`rank(U_TT^*B0^*P_TT)=2`,

`(I-Pi_exact64)B0^*P_TT=0`,

and

`S_64 B0^*P_TT = B0^*P_TT R_TT(2 theta)`.

This closes the canonical finite packet. It still does not independently source
the actual metric shape-map core entries. The remaining source acceptance is the
single statement that the selected `B0` is this canonical same-angle TT co-shape
on the exact central-circle branch.

## Selected Core B0 TT Source Theorem

The selected branch theorem supplies the source acceptance:

`B0^*P_TT = U_TT C`,

where `C` is an invertible TT quotient basis/inner-product normalization. In the
canonical packet, `C=I_2`. This is not a physical parameter and is not fitted to
observed data.

Combining this theorem with the dressed shape-map reduction and the equivariant
support algebra gives:

`Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT`.

Therefore the final BTT support gate is closed:

`support(J_TT)=|d_*> tensor span{c2,s2}`,

and

`lambda_GR,TT=15`

in normalized internal exact-branch units.

## GR TT Support Final Theorem

The exact-branch TT support program is now consolidated into its final support
theorem:

```text
Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT.
```

So the physical TT adjoint co-shape support is:

```text
support(J_TT)=|d_*> tensor span{c2,s2}
```

and the normalized internal exact-branch value is:

```text
lambda_GR,TT=15.
```

This is the correct place to stop reopening BTT support-map gates. The remaining
work is not another helicity/Z64/support proof. It is physical normalization and
full response assembly: a target-independent Newton/Planck anchor, the
stress-energy response map, and proof that the QG execution loop and the GR
response operator are the same selected low-energy object rather than merely
structurally aligned.

## Physical Normalization Stress Response Gate

The structural stress-response slot is now sourced. The GR reduction defines:

```text
T_{mu nu} = -2/sqrt(-g) * delta S_matter / delta g^{mu nu},
```

and the projected Bianchi/Noether identity gives `nabla^mu T_{mu nu}=0` for the
coherent reduced action. The corpus also spells out the coherent scalar,
Yang-Mills, and Dirac stress-tensor forms.

This closes the universal variational stress-response form. It does not yet
close the selected matter/gauge coefficient map or the physical dimensionful
normalization. The normalization slot remains:

```text
G_eff = G_10 / Vol_int
kappa_4^-2 = kappa_11^-2 Vol(X_7)
Vol_int ~= 31.8 R_1^3
```

The unresolved object is therefore sharply:

```text
Selected_Physical_Anchor_and_Einstein_Response_Theorem
```

It must select the dimensionful modal-gap/fundamental-length unit without
observed Newton or Planck input, complete the coherence-to-matter source map,
and prove the QG execution loop and GR response operator are the same selected
low-energy object.

## Selected Physical Anchor Source Hunt

The physical-anchor source hunt did not find a direct selected SI/physical unit
for `G_10`, `ell_p`, `kappa_11`, `alpha_prime`, or `tau`.

The route ranking is now sharp:

```text
best route: M-theory modal gap -> ell_p/kappa_11 -> G_eff
blocked route: Theta 5 TeV matching scale, because it is calibration
open slot: proper-time tau, because Lambda_eff ~ tau^-1/2 is sourced but the
           sector value is not fixed in physical units
```

So the next theorem is:

```text
Selected_Modal_Gap_to_Physical_Unit_Theorem
```

It must derive a selected physical modal-gap scale from fixed-point data and
topological integers, then map that scale into `ell_p`, `kappa_11`,
`alpha_prime`, or `G_10` with no observed Newton, Planck, cosmological, absolute
mass, or TeV calibration input.

## Selected Modal Gap to Physical Unit Theorem

The modal-gap-to-unit algebra is now conditionally closed. The exact branch
gives:

```text
lambda_internal = 15
sqrt(lambda_internal) = sqrt(15)
```

If a selected physical inverse-length unit `omega_gap_phys` is supplied, then:

```text
Lambda_gap_phys = sqrt(15) * omega_gap_phys
ell_p = 1 / Lambda_gap_phys
2 kappa_11^2 = (2 pi)^8 ell_p^9
kappa_4^-2 = kappa_11^-2 Vol(X_7)
G_eff = G_10 / Vol_int
kappa_STF = (32 pi G_eff)^-1
```

So the bridge from a selected physical modal-gap unit to GR/M-theory
normalization is no longer vague. The one missing datum is now:

```text
omega_gap_phys
```

or an equivalent selected physical length/action unit. The next theorem is
therefore:

```text
Selected_Physical_Omega_Gap_Theorem
```

## Selected Physical Omega Gap Theorem

The omega-gap theorem is now reduced to source data. The closed internal pieces
are:

```text
lambda_internal = 15
rho_UV = 0.164530397543639
s_star = 1.464646774701829
kappa = 1
```

The admissible physical form is:

```text
Lambda_gap_phys = sqrt(15) * omega_gap_phys
omega_gap_phys = Omega_0 / s_star
```

The remaining object is not a GR-specific parameter. It is the same-branch
source theorem for:

```text
C_UV
delta
Omega_0
```

from the selected higher-order correction functional, finite-memory disturbance
covariance, and the exact damping Hessian normalization. This gives the next
artifact:

```text
Selected_Higher_Order_Correction_and_Disturbance_Covariance_Theorem
```

## Selected Higher-Order Correction and Disturbance Covariance Theorem

The source-data gate is now precise enough to audit mechanically. The closed
inputs are:

```text
G_11 = 1
U_raw = (v1_tilde, 0, 0)
v1_tilde(alpha_prime=1) = 64*(2*pi)^2/(16*R^4+8)
kappa = 1
lambda_internal = 15
K_ret,64 = S^-1 = S^63
```

The shortcut `||D_raw||^2=1` is not source-certified. The disturbance power has
to be computed from the selected finite-memory covariance:

```text
d_Q = int_R P K_ret Q_tau K_ret^* P^* dt
rho_UV = C_UV^2 / d_Q
s_star = (60 rho_UV)^(1/6)
Lambda_gap_phys = sqrt(15) * Omega_0 / s_star
```

So the remaining primitives are no longer blurry:

```text
C_UV
Q_tau
Omega_0
```

The next three executable closures should evaluate the selected higher-order
correction functional, derive the selected finite-memory carrier covariance,
and select the physical unit `Omega_0` without target backsolving.

## Selected Character-Channel Covariance Import

The non-SM constants repo has a stronger selected-branch result than the generic
covariance reduction. On the selected `q_64=15` character line:

```text
Q_char = E_15 = |15><15|
K_ret,64 acts by a unit phase
d_Q = ||D_raw||^2 = 1
G_11 = 1
```

Together with the final selected radius theorem:

```text
R_star = 4.440528182269818
C_UV_internal = ||U|| = 0.405623467693425
rho_UV = 0.164530397543639
s_star = 1.464646774701829
```

This imports the internal `Q_tau/C_UV` side of the source-data gate into the
GR/protospinor chain, conditional on the same character-channel identification
premise used in the non-SM proof:

```text
the unresolved disturbance channel is the selected q_64=15 character channel,
not a deck-position covariance or trace-one mixture over all 64 characters.
```

The remaining physical formula is now:

```text
Lambda_gap_phys = sqrt(15) * Omega_0 / 1.464646774701829
```

So the principal open gate is the target-independent source theorem for the
physical unit `Omega_0`.

## GR TT Character-Channel Identification Stress Test

The covariance import and the GR TT support theorem are aligned on the same
selected exact Z64/q64 infrastructure:

```text
exact Z64 branch: q_64 = 15
covariance channel: E_15 K_64
GR TT support: |d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}
lambda_GR,TT = 15
```

But the subspaces should not be conflated. `E_15 K_64` is the selected CP
character line used by the rho_UV covariance closure. The GR TT support is the
real helicity-2 response plane over the exact `d_*` branch. These are aligned
shared selected data, not a literal identity of representation slots.

Therefore the current rigorous status is:

```text
shared internal scale import: allowed
literal GR TT stochastic channel = E_15: open optional strengthening
physical Omega_0: open principal gate
```

## Selected Physical Omega0 Source Theorem

The `Omega_0` gate is now reduced to a concrete damping-normalization source
problem. The selected exact Z64 damping Hessian closes:

```text
lambda_star_norm = 15
```

and the legal physical schema is:

```text
tau_adm = log(C_Q/epsilon_adm) / lambda_star
Lambda_eff = sqrt(lambda_star / log(C_Q/epsilon_adm))
Omega_0 = chi_omega * sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(C_Q/epsilon_adm))
omega_gap_phys = Omega_0 / s_star
Lambda_gap_phys = sqrt(15) * Omega_0 / s_star
```

with:

```text
s_star = 1.464646774701829
```

The internal finite-resolution candidates under `C_Q=1`, `epsilon_adm=1/N`,
and normalized `alpha=1` are executable, but they remain internal-only. Physical
closure still requires a source theorem for:

```text
alpha_phys
C_Q
epsilon_adm
chi_omega
selected N, if finite-resolution selection is used
```

## Selected Admissibility Tolerance and Semigroup Bound Theorem

The `C_Q`/`epsilon_adm` part of the `Omega_0` formula has been reduced to a
finite candidate problem. The executable internal candidate family is:

```text
C_Q = 1
epsilon_adm = 1/N
N in {64, 79, 448}
```

with:

```text
N=64   exact dyadic Z64 carrier
N=79   selected q79 label scaffold
N=448  combined Z64 x Z7 quotient candidate
```

All three candidates pass the internal `R1 <= 2` central-circle admissibility
test when the exact `lambda_star=15` damping Hessian is used. The remaining
source task is not numerical arithmetic; it is the physical branch-selection
theorem proving which `N`, or which basin-separation tolerance, is selected for
`Omega_0`, and whether `C_Q=1` is the sharp semigroup bound rather than a
normalized candidate.

## Selected Finite Resolution Branch Theorem

The finite-resolution branch is now selected from the already closed q79
exact-charge corpus. The imported branch is:

```text
Gamma_CP ~= Z64 x Z7 ~= Z448
q64 = 15
q7 = 2
q = 79 mod 448
```

Therefore, for an `Omega_0` route that uses the selected finite CP quotient as
the admissibility resolution,

```text
N = |Gamma_CP| = 448.
```

This rules out the two tempting alternatives as selected branch sizes:

```text
N=64   exact dyadic carrier only; it omits the selected Z7 charge sector
N=79   CP character label q mod 448, not quotient order
N=448  selected CP quotient Z64 x Z7 ~= Z448
```

The theorem is careful about topology. It does not assert that the full flavor
topology is `Z448`; the q79 corpus gives the quotient map:

```text
pi: Z1344 -> Z448
ker(pi) = Z3-family
```

So the rigorous claim is only that the family-trivial CP observable factors
through the selected finite quotient `Z448`.

If the quotient-cell tolerance rule is accepted,

```text
epsilon_adm = 1/|Gamma_CP| = 1/448,
```

then:

```text
Omega0 = chi_omega * sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448*C_Q)).
```

If a later theorem proves the sharp physical semigroup bound `C_Q=1`, this
specializes to:

```text
Omega0 = chi_omega * sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448))
sqrt(15/log(448)) = 1.56750938592616.
```

Thus the finite branch is selected, while the quotient-cell rule, `C_Q`,
`alpha_phys`, and `chi_omega` remain the honest normalization gates.

## Quotient Cell Admissibility Rule Theorem

The quotient-cell tolerance rule is now closed for the selected finite Haar
model. On:

```text
Gamma_CP ~= Z448,
```

the canonical invariant probability measure is normalized counting measure:

```text
mu({g}) = 1/448.
```

An unresolved finite-branch event is a union of selected quotient cells, so its
possible positive masses are:

```text
k/448,  k=1,...,448.
```

The smallest positive unresolved mass is therefore:

```text
epsilon_adm = 1/448.
```

This is not a fit to `G_N`, Planck data, observed `Omega_0`, or any target
constant. It is the cell scale of the selected finite CP quotient.

The `Omega_0` formula is now:

```text
Omega0 = chi_omega * sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448*C_Q)).
```

If `C_Q=1` is later proved as the sharp physical semigroup bound, then:

```text
Omega0 = chi_omega * sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448)).
```

The remaining normalization gates are now exactly:

```text
C_Q
alpha_phys
chi_omega
```

## Selected Sharp Semigroup Bound Theorem

The semigroup prefactor is now closed on the selected exact central-circle
branch:

```text
C_Q = 1.
```

The imported damping generator is:

```text
L_64 = alpha L_tower
alpha > 0
normalized alpha = 1
lambda_star = 15
Schur correction = 0
```

Since this is a positive self-adjoint Hessian block on the selected orthogonal
complement, the spectral theorem gives:

```text
|| exp(-t L_64) Q || <= exp(-15 t).
```

The prefactor is exactly `1`: a larger value is weaker, and a smaller value
fails at `t=0` for normalized complement states. This is a selected exact-branch
statement, not a claim about an unprojected nonnormal mixed Hessian.

Together with:

```text
epsilon_adm = 1/448,
```

the physical normalization formula is now:

```text
Omega0 = chi_omega * sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448)).
```

The remaining normalization gates are reduced to:

```text
alpha_phys
chi_omega
```

## Selected Omega Convention Theorem

The dimensionless convention factor is now closed:

```text
chi_omega = 1.
```

This is a symbol convention, not a physical parameter. The selected convention
is:

```text
Omega0 := Lambda_eff,phys
```

while the post-radius physical gap unit remains:

```text
omega_gap_phys = Omega0 / s_star
s_star = 1.46464677470183.
```

The alternative convention `Omega0=s_star*omega_gap_phys` is mathematically
equivalent, but would make `Omega0` a derived post-radius symbol rather than
the primitive source scale used in the Omega0 gate.

Therefore the physical formula is reduced to:

```text
Omega0 = sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448))
Omega0/sqrt(alpha_phys) = 1.56750938592616.
```

The only remaining physical normalization gate in this chain is:

```text
alpha_phys
```

## Selected Physical Alpha or Action Unit Theorem

The remaining physical normalization gate is now classified exactly.

Closed internally:

```text
alpha_int = 1
G10_int = 1
```

These are canonical exact-branch action units. They are not SI predictions.

The final reduction is:

```text
Omega0 = sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448))
Omega0/sqrt(alpha_phys) = 1.56750938592616.
```

The current corpus does not select a physical numeric value for `alpha_phys`.
This is not a missing arithmetic step; it is the certified dimensionful
normalization obstruction. Dimensionless internal data cannot predict an
absolute physical unit without one independently selected dimensional anchor.

Forbidden moves:

```text
set alpha_phys=1 and call it SI physics
backsolve alpha_phys from observed Newton or Planck data
promote Theta 5 TeV calibration into a prediction
fit Omega0 to cosmology or masses
```

Thus the exact branch is closed up to one external action/unit anchor:

```text
N = 448
epsilon_adm = 1/448
C_Q = 1
chi_omega = 1
Omega0 = sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448)).
```

## Target Independent Dimensional Anchor Search

The search for a current target-independent dimensional anchor is exhausted
against the verified certificates.

Classification:

```text
M-theory/modal gap     best structural route; selected physical value open
Theta 5 TeV            calibration only, forbidden as no-knob anchor
proper time tau        promising slot, physical value open
flux/Bianchi alpha'    promising string slot, string length open
coherence capacity     structural relation, physical normalization open
target backsolve       forbidden
unit convention        forbidden as physical prediction
```

The best route remains the M-theory/modal-gap Planck anchor because it provides
the correct physical slot: a single length/action scale would determine
`ell_p`, `kappa_11`, the 4D gravitational normalization, and the TT response
scale together. What is missing is a selected physical modal-gap value computed
before comparison to Newton, Planck, cosmological, mass, or TeV calibration
data.

The verifier now writes:

```text
candidate_data/selected_dimensional_anchor_packet.template.json
```

Any future claim to close `alpha_phys` must fill this packet with the selected
dimensionful quantity, source certificates, no-target-input proof, dimensional
analysis, convention factors, and the formula mapping the anchor to
`alpha_phys`.

## M-Theory Dimensional Anchor Packet Attempt

The first concrete packet attempt fills the best route as far as current sources
allow:

```text
candidate_id = m_theory_modal_gap_planck_anchor
dimensionful slot = ell_p or Lambda_gap_phys^-1
```

It imports the M-theory relations:

```text
2 kappa_11^2 = (2 pi)^8 ell_p^9
kappa_4^-2 = kappa_11^-2 Vol(X_7)
M_P^2 proportional to Vol(X_7)/ell_p^9
```

and the selected GR/protospinor formula:

```text
Omega0 = sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448)).
```

The packet does not promote because the current corpus still does not compute a
selected physical value for:

```text
ell_p
kappa_11
alpha_prime
Lambda_gap_phys
Omega0
alpha_phys
```

Thus the exact blocker is no longer structural bookkeeping; it is the missing
selected physical modal-gap value.

## Physical Modal Gap Closure Plan and First Attempt

Plan:

```text
1. compute selected dimensionless modal damping scale
2. test whether it is already a physical dimensionful unit
3. try M-theory modal-gap promotion
4. search for same-branch physical clock/length source
5. if found, fill dimensional-anchor packet and promote alpha_phys
```

Executed now:

```text
lambda_star = 15
C_Q = 1
epsilon_adm = 1/448
tau_int = log(448)/15 = 0.406986215494332
Lambda_eff,int = sqrt(15/log(448)) = 1.56750938592616
```

The internal `tau_int` route does not close the physical modal gap. In physical
momentum sectors:

```text
[tau] = E^-2.
```

Therefore `tau_phys` still requires the same missing physical unit,
equivalently `alpha_phys`. The next executable artifact is:

```text
Same_Branch_Physical_Clock_or_Length_Source_Search_v1
```

## Same Branch Physical Clock or Length Source Search

The search finds the structural source in the wider MTT corpus. The finite
coherent projection papers identify:

```text
[tau] = L^2 = E^-2
ell_coh = sqrt(tau)
Lambda_eff = tau^-1/2
```

The quantum-gravity and spectral-action papers use the same proper-time object
as SPT/coherent cutoff data. Therefore the selected exact branch now supports:

```text
tau_int = log(448)/15 = 0.406986215494332
tau_phys = tau_int / alpha_phys
ell_coh = sqrt(tau_int / alpha_phys)
Lambda_eff = sqrt(alpha_phys / tau_int)
```

This closes the same-branch physical clock/length bridge, but not the absolute
SI value. The remaining theorem is:

```text
Dimensional_Metrology_NoGo_and_Relative_Closure_Theorem_v1
```

It should formalize the boundary: MTT has closed the relative physical
clock/length/gap chain on this branch, while absolute numeric dimensionful
closure still needs one selected metrological primitive or an independently
constructed physical rod/clock process.

## Dimensional Metrology No-Go and Relative Closure

The calculated solution is now closed as a relative physical scale theorem:

```text
tau_int = log(448)/15 = 0.406986215494332
sqrt(tau_int) = 0.637954712729934
1/sqrt(tau_int) = 1.56750938592616
```

The physical formulas are:

```text
tau_phys = tau_int / alpha_phys
ell_coh = sqrt(tau_int / alpha_phys)
Lambda_eff = sqrt(alpha_phys / tau_int)
Omega0 = sqrt(alpha_phys) * sqrt(15/log(448))
```

Thus no-knob relative closure is complete. The only way to get absolute SI
numbers is to supply one metrological primitive. For a length primitive `L0`:

```text
alpha_phys = tau_int / L0^2
tau_phys = L0^2
ell_coh = L0
Lambda_eff = 1/L0
Omega0 = sqrt(tau_int)/L0
```

For an energy primitive `E0`:

```text
alpha_phys = tau_int * E0^2
tau_phys = 1/E0^2
ell_coh = 1/E0
Lambda_eff = E0
Omega0 = sqrt(tau_int)*E0
```

This proves the no-go boundary in the present formalization: absolute
dimensionful values are invariantly underdetermined by one positive scale unless
MTT supplies an internal physical rod/clock construction.

## One Anchor GR Normalization Propagation

The one-anchor family now propagates into the selected GR normalization row.
For `N=448`:

```text
Vol_int = 8.25651301926521
G_eff,int = 0.121116504953927
kappa_STF,int = 0.0821290537324154
G_eff,int * kappa_STF,int = 1/(32*pi)
```

If the physical coherent length is `L0`, then:

```text
G_eff = 0.297593629324318 * L0^2
kappa_STF = 0.0334253927606864 / L0^2
Omega0 = 0.637954712729934 / L0
```

If the physical coherent energy is `E0`, then:

```text
G_eff = 0.297593629324318 / E0^2
kappa_STF = 0.0334253927606864 * E0^2
Omega0 = 0.637954712729934 * E0
```

This closes the one-anchor GR normalization family without adding a GR-specific
parameter and without using observed Newton or Planck data.

## One Anchor Einstein Response Assembly

The conditional low-energy TT Einstein response is now assembled from the closed
pieces:

```text
Pi_exact64 B^*P_TT = B^*P_TT
lambda_GR,TT,int = 15
kappa_STF = (32*pi*G_eff)^(-1)
```

With length anchor `L0`:

```text
h_TT = 29.9173747084929 * L0^2 * G_ret,TT T_TT
```

With energy anchor `E0`:

```text
h_TT = 29.9173747084929 * E0^-2 * G_ret,TT T_TT
```

This closes the conditional one-anchor TT response assembly. It does not yet
claim full unconditional physical GR. The remaining explicit gates are:

```text
selected full matter stress coefficients
unconditional GR TT operator identity
literal GR TT noise-channel identity
absolute SI metrology, if measured numbers are required
```

## Cross-Repo Remaining Gates Source Triage

The adjacent proof repositories have now been checked against the remaining
gates. No missed closed theorem was found.

Classification:

```text
absolute SI metrology:
  confirmed open by the non-SM dimensionful-constant obstruction

selected full matter stress coefficients:
  partially reduced by q79 and sm-parity, but selected payload values remain
  open

unconditional GR TT operator identity:
  current repo remains the best gate; no sibling proof closes it

literal GR TT noise-channel identity:
  optional strengthening open; shared exact Z64 infrastructure is not literal
  identity of the GR TT plane and the covariance character line
```

The useful imports are guardrails and interfaces rather than final coefficients:
Qa/SU3 gives finite selected Hessian/retarded-kernel validator discipline,
sm-parity gives selected S3/Phi_fin source scaffolding, and q79 gives the
explicit warning that full SM data are absent until selected overlap kernels,
metrics, neutral/Higgs data, and matching are computed from the same branch.

Therefore the next executable gate is:

```text
Selected_Matter_Payload_Import_Interface_v1
```

## Selected Matter Payload Import Interface

The selected matter/source gate is now an explicit interface. The GR side has
the universal variational stress form, but needs same-branch selected values
from the q79/sm-parity source program.

Required import slots:

```text
selected source branch
selected sector projectors and zero-mode bases
selected D_E, Riesz/Green, and dotD values
finite C1 Hessian blocks and deltaTheta response
primitive overlap contractions
family kinetic metrics
neutral-sector, Higgs, and matching data
```

This closes the bridge specification between selected matter payloads and the
GR stress-response gate. It does not yet close the selected matter stress
coefficients, because the sibling repos currently provide support shapes and
validators rather than emitted selected payload values.

The next executable object is now:

```text
SelectedSpectralGalerkinProjectorRetentionData_or_SelectedHYMOperatorPayloadValues
```

## Selected Route-C Payload Value Import Attempt

The import was attempted against the latest Route-C/Strominger/Galerkin payloads
from the sm-parity and q79 repositories.

What exists:

```text
filled Galerkin first-run manifest
formal/lifted diagnostic pipeline
model-active sector projectors and dotD matrices
candidate D_E, Riesz/Green, and route residual files
source-emission contract for the correction/C1 layer
```

What blocks promotion:

```text
selected_by_mtt = false
selected_source_verified = false
alpha1_driver_verified = false
proof_promotion_allowed = false
primitive C1 contractions open
selected deltaTheta_C1 solution open
family kinetic metrics open
neutral/Higgs/matching data open
```

Therefore the GR stress-response gate cannot yet import selected matter stress
coefficients. The next true object is now:

```text
MTT_RouteC_Selected_Source_Origin_Lemma_v1
```

or, if the source origin is supplied independently:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Splitter_Source_Emission_Contract_or_Selected_DeltaTheta_C1_Solve_v1
```

## Route-C Selected Source-Origin Paper Lemma

The Route-C selected source-origin lemma has now been proved in the strongest
form justified by the certificates:

```text
fixed q79/F,m=1 S3/GS support
+ selected Strominger/HYM minimizer
+ functorial Phi_fin finite trace
=> theorem-derived selected Route-C finite payload
```

The support part is closed. The conditional theorem is proved. The
unconditional theorem remains open because `Phi_fin` has not emitted selected
payload values or the required error/gap certificate.

The paper-ready insertion is:

```text
proof_corpus/paper_insertions/RouteC_Selected_Source_Origin_Lemma_for_Strominger_Paper.md
```

It should be added to:

```text
Modal_Triplet_Theory__From_MTT_to_the_Strominger__Heterotic_Flux__System.md
```

as a conditional lemma/proof slot, with the guardrail that no observed masses,
mixings, thresholds, Newton/Planck values, or fitted constants are used to
select the source, branch, cover, operator, or promotion flag.

## Phi_fin Finite RhoE Trace Construction

The finite `rho_E` trace component of `Phi_fin` is now constructed. The old
identity-smoke route is replaced by a non-identity rank-3 Heisenberg/Weyl
projective packet on the selected active `F3 x F3` deck shadow:

```text
rho_E(g1)^3 = rho_E(g2)^3 = I
rho_E(g1) rho_E(g2) = omega^-1 rho_E(g2) rho_E(g1)
rho_E(g3)=...=rho_E(g6)=I
```

The verifier checks unitarity, order-three residuals, and the projective
commutator numerically. This closes the finite non-identity `rho_E` piece of
`Phi_fin`.

It does not yet close full `Phi_fin` selected payload emission. The remaining
source promotion and operator payload gates are:

```text
selected Strominger/HYM source certificate
source promotion for rho_E
selected D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD data
selected C1 response
honest replay without lifted flags
```

## Phi_fin Operator Payload Scaffold Import

The next finite layer is now imported as a scaffold rather than asserted as a
selected source theorem. The Route-C smooth `B_N` packets supply explicit
operator data in the common basis:

```text
F3xF3_gerbe_twisted_fourier_N1_rank3
```

The imported payload contains `D_E` matrices for `H,L,N,Q,d,e,u`, sector
projectors for the same sectors, and `dotD_alpha1` matrices in the same
27-mode basis. The zero-mode counts match the branch pattern:

```text
dim ker(H) = 1
dim ker(L,N,Q,d,e,u) = 3
```

The C1 primitive contraction engine is also present. For the canonical
translation-invariant primitive, the finite response matrices vanish. This is a
useful no-go: nonzero C1 data cannot be obtained by reusing the invariant
primitive alone. The remaining proof must derive a selected non-invariant
primitive, selected basis transport, or vertex/source correction from the same
branch.

The exact status is:

```text
PHIFIN_OPERATOR_PAYLOAD_SCAFFOLD_IMPORTED_SOURCE_PROMOTION_AND_C1_OPEN
```

This does not set any selected-source flag. The proof-critical values remain:

```text
D_E selected_source_verified = false
dotD selected_dotD_source_verified = false
dotD alpha1_driver_verified = false
```

Therefore the next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_BasisTransport_Primitive_Source_Theorem_v1
```

## Route-C BasisTransport Gate Reduction Import

The named basis-transport theorem slot exists in the sibling SM repository, and
its finite support reductions are now imported into this GR/protospinor ledger.
The reduction proves:

```text
active C1 deck shift = (1,1)
fixed qutrit fiber shifts 0,1,2 = one current-layer spectral gauge class
shift 0 = legal computation gauge for current spectral invariants
```

This resolves the current finite fiber-choice ambiguity but not the source
theorem. The imported invariant scope is rank, determinant magnitude, traces of
`YY*` powers, and singular spectra for the current fixed-fiber C1 matrices. The
same artifact explicitly records why this is not flavor closure: the current
layer still has degenerate singular values, so nondegenerate Yukawa hierarchy,
CKM, and PMNS require higher-order/full-response splitting or selected
operator-level basis transport.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_BASISTRANSPORT_GATE_REDUCED_SOURCE_PROOF_OPEN
```

The next artifact is no longer a vague "find the primitive" task. It is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_BasisTransport_Primitive_Source_Proof_or_Counterexample_v1
```

## Route-C BasisTransport Proof-or-Counterexample Import

The proof-or-counterexample gate has now been imported from the sibling SM
repository. It rules out the primitive-only route as sufficient.

Even if the current non-invariant primitive family were conditionally promoted,
the finite real span of the fixed-fiber primitive responses does not contain
the locked qutrit/Weyl splitter target. Adding the all-fiber envelope does not
help; the relative residual remains approximately:

```text
0.7772815877574014
```

Therefore the I7 source theorem must be strengthened. The selected source must
emit a Weyl-pair basis-transport or vertex response containing both:

```text
phase-like qutrit Z component or equivalent basis holonomy
shift-like qutrit X component tied to active shift (1,1)
```

The current scalar-permutation C1 layer is also proved too degenerate for
flavor closure: for each sector, `Y0 Y0*` is scalar identity. It cannot by
itself yield nondegenerate Yukawa hierarchy, CKM/PMNS mixing, or CP violation.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_PRIMITIVE_ONLY_COUNTEREXAMPLE_IMPORTED_WEYL_PAIR_SOURCE_OPEN
```

The next source theorem is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_BasisTransport_or_Vertex_Source_Theorem_v1
```

After that source theorem exists, the next value artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_First_Selected_Correction_Matrix_Search_or_Galerkin_Run_v1
```

## Route-C WeylPair Source Gate Import

The enriched Weyl-pair gate is now imported. This closes the algebraic
sufficiency question that followed the primitive-only counterexample.

The minimal packet has two source directions:

```text
phase_packet: u,e = I + Z; d,nuD = 0
shift_packet: d,nuD = I + X; u,e = 0
```

The two-column real span reconstructs the locked qutrit/Weyl splitter target:

```text
target_in_span = true
relative residual = 2.2434564674474914e-16
```

This is the correct finite algebraic target for `A_selected`. It does not yet
prove that the selected `q79/F,m=1` `S3`/Green-Schwarz Route-C source emits the
phase-like `Z`/basis-holonomy component or the shift-like `X`/vertex component.
It also does not emit `A_selected`, `b_selected`, or solve `DeltaTheta_C1`.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_WEYLPAIR_SOURCE_GATE_IMPORTED_ASELECTED_SOURCE_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_Aselected_Assembly_or_Source_Proof_v1
```

## Route-C WeylPair Aselected Assembly Import

The conditional Weyl-pair operator assembly is now imported. Conditioned on
the source emitting the two Weyl-pair columns, the operator

```text
A_weylpair_conditional = [phase_packet, shift_packet]
```

has:

```text
shape = 72 x 2
rank = 2
condition number = 1
deltaTheta_conditional = (1,1)
relative residual = 1.5700924586837752e-16
```

This removes the algebraic rank/consistency obstruction at the two-column
Weyl-pair layer. It does not promote `A_weylpair_conditional` to `A_selected`,
and it does not emit `b_selected`.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_WEYLPAIR_CONDITIONAL_A_SOLVE_BUILT_SOURCE_PROVENANCE_OPEN
```

The remaining blocker is now a single provenance lemma:

```text
SelectedWeylPairSourceProvenanceLemma
```

It must prove that the selected `q79/F,m=1` `S3`/Green-Schwarz Route-C source
emits the phase-like `I+Z` basis-holonomy packet and shift-like `I+X`
active-vertex packet in the same `B_N`/projector/dotD/zero-mode basis, with
internal normalization.

## Route-C Source Provenance or Basis Reduction Import

The conditional Weyl-pair solve reduces the algebraic obstruction to selected
source provenance. The imported sibling Route-C audits now close the support
side of the reduction:

```text
provenance support stack closed
B_N basis support stack closed
target fitting excluded
```

They do not close the selected primitive gates. The exact blockers are:

```text
R1: selected Phi_fin payload values from the selected Strominger/HYM minimizer
R4: quotient/deck-valid B_N basis certificate with selected D_E action
R6: honest replay without lifted flags
```

Thus the current theorem is a reduction theorem, not a selected-source theorem.
It proves that no hidden matrix-rank or dimensional obstruction remains after
the Weyl-pair conditional solve; the open problem is emitting the selected
finite primitive data from the same branch.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_PROVENANCE_BASIS_SUPPORT_CLOSED_SELECTED_PRIMITIVES_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Selected_Primitive_Emission_Search_v1
```

## Route-C Selected Primitive Emission Search Import

The selected primitive emission search has now been imported. It closes a
useful negative question: the R1/R4/R6 blockage is not merely missing wiring
inside existing artifacts.

What exists:

```text
selected S3/F3^2 deck scaffold
formal-lift algebra useful for downstream diagnostics
support stacks from the previous reduction
```

What does not legally promote:

```text
selected Phi_fin payload values
selected non-identity rho_E payload
quotient/deck-valid B_N basis payload
selected D_E action and metric quadrature
honest R6 replay without lifted flags
```

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_SELECTED_PRIMITIVE_EMISSION_SEARCH_IMPORTED_NO_LEGAL_EMISSION_FOUND
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_NonIdentity_RhoE_and_BN_Construction_v1
```

## Route-C Non-Identity rhoE / BN Construction Import

The first constrained numerical repair has been imported. On the selected
`F3^2` deck shadow, the canonical rank-3 Heisenberg/Weyl packet gives a real
non-identity projective `rho_E` candidate:

```text
unitary residual < 1e-10
order-three residual < 1e-10
projective commutator residual < 1e-10
active deck rank over F3 = 2
```

This closes the finite `rho_E` numerical packet gate and replaces the old
identity-smoke diagnostic. It does not yet close selected source promotion:
the packet is compatible with the selected deck/cocycle shadow, but still needs
a source certificate tying it to the selected Strominger/HYM minimizer.

The `B_N` side remains open. The current object is only a finite twisted
deck/fiber scaffold; it does not emit the smooth scalar Galerkin functions,
metric quadrature, selected `D_E` action, Gram/stiffness entries, generalized
eigenpairs, or gap/error certificate.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_NONIDENTITY_RHOE_NUMERICAL_PACKET_IMPORTED_BN_STILL_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Smooth_BN_Galerkin_Lift_v1
```

## Route-C Smooth B_N Galerkin Lift Import

The first smooth `B_N` scaffold is now imported. It lifts the finite
`F3^2 x C3` deck/fiber packet to a gerbe-twisted Fourier Galerkin scaffold.

Closed in the model active-laplacian scaffold:

```text
basis dimension = 27
zero cluster dimension = 3
complement gap = 4.386490844928603
quadrature = 3 x 3 active-deck trapezoid rule
Gram matrix = identity
model stiffness = diagonal active-deck Laplacian
Riesz projector and reduced Green operator emitted
```

This is still not the full selected Iwasawa/Strominger `B_N` payload. The
remaining source-critical objects are:

```text
selected D_E action on the smooth basis
sector projectors and ordered zero-mode bases
dotD_alpha1 in the same basis
full Iwasawa truncation-error certificate
honest R6 replay without lifted flags
```

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_SMOOTH_BN_GALERKIN_LIFT_IMPORTED_SELECTED_DE_STILL_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_DE_Action_on_Smooth_BN_v1
```

## Route-C D_E Action on Smooth B_N Import

The finite `D_E` action on the 27-mode smooth `B_N` scaffold is now imported.
The matrix-consistency layer is closed:

```text
domain dimension = 27
family kernel dimension = 3
family range dimension = 24
Higgs kernel dimension = 1
Higgs range dimension = 26
stiffness = D_E^* D_E
zero-mode bases ordered
diagnostic q79 validator passes
```

The honest packet still does not promote. Its validator fails because
`selected_source_verified` is not theorem-derived for the sectors. The current
operator is also still the model active `D_E`, not yet the full selected
Iwasawa/Strominger action with truncation-error certificate.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_DE_ACTION_ON_SMOOTH_BN_IMPORTED_SOURCE_PROMOTION_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Sector_Projectors_and_DotD_on_Smooth_BN_v1
```

## Route-C Sector Projectors and dotD on Smooth B_N Import

Sector projectors and `dotD_alpha1` response slots on the same 27-mode smooth
`B_N` basis are now imported.

Closed at the finite horizontal-response algebra level:

```text
Q,u,d,L,e,N projector rank = 3
H projector rank = 1
projectors are Hermitian and idempotent
dotPsi_i = -R Q dotD Psi_i passes diagnostic validation
diagnostic q79 dotD validator passes
```

The honest packet remains unpromoted. The source-critical flags are still not
theorem-derived:

```text
selected_dotD_source_verified
alpha1_driver_verified
primitive C1 overlap contractions
full Iwasawa/Strominger D_E rather than model active D_E
full truncation-error certificate
honest replay without lifted flags
```

MTT_Selected_RouteC_C1_Primitive_Response_or_Selected_Source_Proof_v1
```

## Route-C C1 Primitive Response on Smooth B_N Import

The first natural C1 primitive-response contraction has been imported on the
same 27-mode `B_N` basis. The tested primitive is the canonical finite
translation-invariant trilinear tensor with active `F3^2` mode conservation and
qutrit fiber conservation.

```text
nonzero primitive tensor slots = 729
u,d,e,nuD one-response C1 matrices = 0
```

This zero result is a finite selection-rule theorem, not numerical noise. The
emitted horizontal responses live in active mode `(-1,-1)`, while zero modes
and the Higgs zero mode live in `(0,0)`. A one-response trilinear term therefore
violates canonical active-mode conservation.

No Yukawa, CKM, PMNS, mass, or full SM closure claim is made here.

Nonzero C1 response now requires one of:

```text
selected non-invariant C1 primitive or vertex tensor
selected basis transport mixing zero and response modes
same-source theorem deriving a different selected trilinear tensor
full Iwasawa/Strominger data whose response support changes the rule
```

The exact status is:

```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_NonInvariant_C1_Primitive_or_BasisTransport_Search_v1
```

## Route-C Non-Invariant C1 Primitive Search Import

The non-invariant C1 repair search is now imported.

The canonical C1 tensor vanishes because the `dotD` response has active mode
`(-1,-1)` while zero modes have `(0,0)`. The minimal repair therefore carries
active shift:

```text
(1,1)
```

The finite search emitted nonzero unselected candidates for:

```text
fiber shifts = 0, 1, 2, all
```

Each fixed fiber-shift candidate has rank-3 `u,d,e,nuD` matrices; the all-fiber
envelope has rank 1 in the emitted finite packet.

Selected C1 closure is still false. No observed Yukawa, CKM, PMNS, or mass data
were used.

The remaining proof object is one of:

```text
source theorem selecting the non-invariant primitive/vertex
fiber-rule audit selecting 0, 1, 2, or all from rho_E/Chan-Paton data
selected basis-transport theorem with the same finite effect
```

The exact status is:

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Primitive_Source_Selection_Theorem_or_FiberRule_Audit_v1
```

## Route-C Primitive Source Selection / Fiber-Rule Audit Import

The Route-C primitive source-selection audit is now imported.

It proves the strongest finite selection facts currently available without
observed Yukawa, CKM, PMNS, or mass data:

```text
active shift (1,1) is forced by finite support
fixed qutrit fiber shifts 0,1,2 form one cyclic gauge class
the all-fiber envelope is rank 1 and is not a fixed single-charge primitive
```

Thus the previous unselected candidate search is reduced to a sharper gate.
The selected source data currently choose the period-three projective qutrit
class, but they do not yet choose an absolute qutrit fiber origin or a unique
operator-level primitive.

Selected C1 closure is still false. The next required proof is either a selected
fiber-origin gauge fix, observable invariance under the fixed-fiber class, or an
equivalent selected primitive/basis-transport source theorem.

The exact status is:

```text
ROUTEC_PRIMITIVE_SOURCE_SELECTION_AUDIT_IMPORTED_ACTIVE_SHIFT_FORCED_FIBER_CLASS_OPEN

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_FiberClass_Observable_Invariance_or_GaugeFix_v1
```

## Route-C Fiber-Class Observable Invariance Import

The fixed qutrit fiber class has now been imported through the observable
invariance gate.

For the current finite C1 layer, fixed fiber shifts `0`, `1`, and `2` have the
same spectral invariants in every sector:

```text
rank
absolute determinant
traces of powers of Y Y*
singular spectrum
```

The reason is exact at this layer: each sector matrix is a scalar multiple of a
permutation matrix, hence `Y Y*` is scalar identity. Therefore shift `0` is
legal as a computation gauge for current spectral invariants.

This does not select an absolute qutrit fiber origin, does not prove a unique
selected C1 matrix, and does not close physical flavor. The same theorem says
the current C1 singular spectrum is degenerate, so Yukawa hierarchy, CKM, PMNS,
and CP require selected higher-order corrections, sector-dependent source data,
or full Strominger/Iwasawa response support.

No observed flavor data were used.

The exact status is:

```text

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_HigherOrder_or_FullResponse_FlavorSplitting_v1
```

## Route-C Higher-Order / Full-Response Flavor Splitting Import

The higher-order/full-response flavor-splitting criterion is now imported.

It proves the current finite C1 layer is a flavor no-go:

```text
Y0 Y0* is scalar identity in every sector
```

So the present layer gives exact degeneracy and cannot by itself produce
Yukawa hierarchy, CKM, PMNS, or CP structure.

The next acceptance tests are now fixed without target fitting:

```text
mass splitting: nonzero traceless Hermitian correction
CKM/PMNS: nonzero commutator between sector Hermitian corrections
CP: selected complex CP-odd invariant
```

Selected correction values remain open. They require selected `dotD_alpha1`,
`deltaTheta_C1`, zero-mode bases, primitive C1 contractions, and sector response
matrices from the same honest source.

No observed masses, CKM, PMNS, or CP data were used as selectors.

The exact status is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_First_Selected_Correction_Matrix_Search_or_Galerkin_Run_v1
```

## Route-C First Correction Search / Galerkin Import

The first correction-matrix search and Galerkin replay are now imported.

Lane A found a diagnostic qutrit/Weyl splitter satisfying the locked flavor
tests without observed target data:

```text
nonzero traceless Hermitian mass splitting
nonzero CKM and PMNS commutator norms
nonzero CP-odd commutator-cubed trace invariant
```

Thus the scalar-permutation degeneracy is not algebraically fatal. The finite
correction algebra has enough room for flavor structure.

The splitter is not promoted as selected MTT data. Lane B records that the
honest Galerkin replay still fails selected-source, selected-dotD, and
alpha1-driver gates. Formal-lift diagnostics pass lower validators but remain
diagnostic only.

Selected correction matrices, selected Galerkin values, promoted Yukawa
hierarchy, CKM, PMNS, and CP remain open.

The exact status is:

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_Correction_Source_Emission_or_Selected_Galerkin_Values_v1
```

## Route-C Correction Source Emission Import

The source-emission audit is now imported.

It proves that the diagnostic qutrit/Weyl splitter is not emitted by the current
selected artifacts. The selected Phi_fin alpha1 payload, selected
source-origin/alpha1 driver, and honest Route-C Galerkin first-run stack do not
emit:

```text
selected correction matrices
selected deltaTheta_C1
selected sector response matrices
selected Galerkin values
```

The next proof is now an exact source-emission contract:

```text
selected deltaTheta_C1 or equivalent selected correction source
selected dotD_alpha1
selected lower Hessian/source blocks
selected zero-mode bases
selected primitive C1 contractions
sector response matrices M_u, M_d, M_e, M_nuD
```

After those exist, the locked finite tests are still the nonzero traceless mass
splitting, CKM/PMNS commutator, and complex CP-odd invariant tests, with no
observed flavor targets or lifted flags as proof data.

## Route-C DeltaTheta C1 Solve Gate Import

The selected `deltaTheta_C1` solve gate is now imported.

The diagnostic splitter is encoded as an explicit finite real target vector, and
the selected proof equation is fixed:

```text
A_selected * deltaTheta_C1 = b_splitter
```

The target has real dimension `72`, total norm square `24`, and four sector
blocks of norm square `6`.

The selected response operator is not available yet. The rank, consistency, and
least-squares tests cannot be run until `A_selected` and `b_selected` are
emitted from selected Hessian, selected dotD, selected zero-mode bases, and
selected primitive C1 contractions.

The identity lift is diagnostic only and is rejected as proof data.

## Route-C Selected C1 Response Operator Emission Import

The selected C1 response-operator emission audit is now imported.

Current selected Route-C/Phi_fin/Galerkin artifacts do not emit `A_selected` or
`b_selected`. The q79 template and extraction attempt provide useful structure:
alpha1 driver row, curvature source, response chain, and principal
Hessian-symbol support. But the selected finite data remain null:

```text
finite Hessian blocks
selected source vector
deltaTheta_C1
dotD operators
zero-mode bases
primitive contractions
sector response matrices
```

The lanes are now separated:

```text
canonical smooth B_N C1 response: computed zero
non-invariant primitive candidates: nonzero but unselected
selected C1 template: correct schema but values-open
```

Thus the locked DeltaTheta solve cannot honestly run yet.

The exact status is:

## Route-C Selected C1 Operator Source Rebuild Import

The selected C1 rebuild space is now ranked and pruned.

The best next lane is:

```text
L3_noninvariant_basis_transport_or_vertex_source
```

This lane wins because active deck shift `(1,1)` is forced, fixed qutrit fiber
shifts `0,1,2` form one gauge class, nonzero rank-3 finite candidates exist,
and the existing dotD/projector scaffold can be reused without observed targets
or lifted flags.

The straight selected-Hessian lane has the right schema but null finite values.
The canonical smooth `B_N` lane is computed but zero. The full smooth
Iwasawa/Strominger rebuild remains a rigorous fallback, but is broader than the
next proof needed.

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_BasisTransport_Primitive_Source_Theorem_v1
```

## Route-C BasisTransport Primitive Source Theorem Import

The selected Route-C basis-transport primitive source theorem slot is now
imported.

This closes a proof-target and documentation gate, not the selected source
theorem itself. The imported finite support lemmas are:

```text
active deck shift (1,1) is the unique finite nonzero C1 lane
fixed qutrit fiber shifts 0,1,2 are a current finite gauge class
nonzero rank-3 candidates exist
dotD/projector scaffold exists in the same finite basis
```

The named theorem slot is:

```text
SelectedBasisTransportPrimitiveSourceTheorem
```

The boundary remains strict. The artifact does not derive the basis transport or
vertex primitive from the selected q79/F,m=1 S3/GS source, does not lift the
fixed-fiber quotient to downstream observables, does not emit `A_selected` or
`b_selected`, and does not solve the locked splitter equation.

```

## Route-C Weyl-Pair Frontier Reconciliation

The Route-C C1 frontier is now reconciled against the already imported
proof-or-counterexample and Weyl-pair artifacts.

The strict state is:

```text
primitive-only basis transport is insufficient
the enriched Weyl-pair packet spans the locked splitter algebraically
the conditional 72x2 Weyl-pair operator has rank 2
the conditional DeltaTheta_C1 solve has tiny residual
```

This means the remaining blocker is no longer linear algebra or rank. The
remaining blocker is same-branch source provenance:

```text
prove the selected q79/F,m=1 S3/GS source emits the phase-like Weyl column
prove the same selected branch emits the shift-like active (1,1) Weyl column
emit b_selected from the theorem-derived source
promote conditional A_weylpair to A_selected only after provenance is proved
```

The exact status is:

```text

```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_Source_Provenance_Lemma_v1
```

## Route-C Weyl-Pair Source Provenance Import

The Weyl-pair source provenance lemma is now imported as a reduction.

Closed at source level:

```text
g1 = Z phase generator
g2 = X shift generator
both have order 3
the selected q79/F,m=1 S3/GS gerbe supplies the central cocycle
active shift (1,1) has selected active-shift provenance
```

The remaining blocker is the selected transfer map from this source carrier into
the exact C1 response columns:

```text
Z -> u,e = I + Z phase column
X -> d,nuD = I + X shift column
normalization in the same B_N/projector/dotD/zero-mode basis
promotion of conditional A_weylpair to selected A_selected
emission of b_selected
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_SourceToC1_Transfer_Map_v1
```

## Route-C Weyl-Pair SourceToC1 Transfer Import

The conditional source-to-C1 transfer map is now imported.

The algebraic transfer is exact:

```text
T(Z) = sector_route(u,e; I + Z)
T(X) = sector_route(d,nuD; I + X)
phase residual = 0
shift residual = 0
```

The remaining blocker is not the transfer calculation. It is the selected source
of the sector-routing rule and normalization:

```text
why Z routes to u,e as I + Z
why X routes to d,nuD as I + X
why the coefficient normalization is the conditional-solve normalization
```

Until that source lemma is proved, the conditional transfer map cannot be
promoted to selected `A_selected`, and `b_selected` remains open.

The exact status is:

## Route-C Weyl-Pair SectorRouting Source Import

The sector-routing source attempt is now imported.

Closed:

```text
all six two-two routes of {u,d,e,nuD} were enumerated
relative to the locked C1 columns, exactly one route is exact
Z -> u,e as I+Z
X -> d,nuD as I+X
```

Boundary:

```text
this is target-column uniqueness, not independent selected-source routing
```

Current selected artifacts still do not emit a theorem-derived sector charge,
chirality, or conjugation table that forces `{u,e}|{d,nuD}`. Sector projectors
retain the family kernels uniformly, while selected dotD/alpha1 source
verification remains open.

The exact status is:

```text

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_SectorCharge_or_Chirality_Certificate_v1
```

## Route-C Weyl-Pair SectorCharge Import

The sector charge/chirality certificate attempt is now imported.

Route A, the high-scale SU(5)/E6 matter-slot path, gives the strongest
structural match:

```text
u,e   -> 10_M clock/phase side
d     -> bar5_M shift side
nuD   -> 1_M singlet, needing a selected Dirac-neutrino shift rule
```

Route B, the currently honest selected Phi_fin/Route-C block path, does not
split the right-family sectors at the checked layer:

```text
u,d,e,N carry uniform orientation
projector/dotD payloads are identical across checked right-family fields
```

So the certificate remains source-open. The next object must either promote the
matter-slot theorem with selected `10_M`, `bar5_M`, and `1_M` routing, or replace
it with a selected sector-resolved block theorem.

The exact status is:

```text

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_RouteC_WeylPair_MatterSlot_or_BlockSector_Source_Theorem_v1
```

## Route-C Weyl-Pair MatterSlot BlockSector Import

The Weyl-pair matter-slot/block-sector theorem attempt is now imported and
reduced to the hybrid packet.

Route A, high-scale SU(5)/E6 matter slots:

```text
right structural dictionary
finite I_3/F transport is not the blocker
selected source validation remains open
```

Route B, selected block-sector data:

```text
left/right coherence is honest
u/e versus d/nuD sector-resolved C1 routing is not emitted
monolithic SU(5) inheritance from the block route is rejected
```

The q79 D7 equivariant clue helps select the active S3 stack, but it does not
assign matter slots by itself. The next object is therefore the hybrid packet:

```text
selected HYM/Strominger source
selected D_E, Riesz/Green, dotD
selected Galerkin zero modes and L2 metrics
selected 10_M/bar5_M/1_M or u,d,e,N sector routing
Weyl-pair A_selected normalization
```

## Route-C Hybrid MatterSlot Galerkin Import

The hybrid matter-slot Galerkin packet attempt is now imported.

What is present:

```text
three-dimensional model zero cluster
positive complement gap
Riesz/reduced Green model
sector projectors
dotD alpha1 matrix shapes
```

What blocks selection:

```text
selected D_E source flag is false
selected dotD source flag is false
alpha1 driver flag is false
matter-slot source flag is false
checked family bases are identical
current relative transport is I_3
```

The conditional SU(5) fixture has `10_M` clock and `bar5_M` shift shape, but it
is not selected by MTT and lacks the selected `1_M` singlet-neutrino shift rule.

The exact status is:

The next executable artifact is:

## Route-C Source/Overlap Packet Chain Import

The selected operator-source and overlap chain is now imported through the
same-source fill/no-go checkpoint.

Closed or sharply localized:

```text
source-level qutrit Weyl carrier
conditional C1 route: Z -> u/e and X -> d/nuD
conditional deltaTheta = (1,1)
finite SU(5) transversality support: U_10 = I_3, U_bar5 = F
seven-field same-source promotion validator
```

The current scaffold does not validate. It has broad support shapes, but every
required promotion field is support-only, conditional, target-localized, or
absent:

```text
selected theorem-derived same-source fields = 0
A_selected not promoted
b_selected not promoted
```

The important conclusion is that the packet is not waiting for more target-side
finite algebra. It is waiting for selected source emission: source identity,
matter-slot charge including the `1_M` neutrino rule, selected D_E/dotD/Riesz
and Green values, selected overlap transfer, selected trace/Hessian
normalization, and selected primitive contractions must come from the same
selected branch.

MTT_Selected_RouteC_SourceEmission_MinimalSubpacket_AttackPlan_v1

## Route-C SourceEmission Stability Chain Import

The source-emission chain is now imported through the selected equal-radius
Gauduchon HYM bridge.

Closed or advanced:

```text
source-emission plan split into ordered subpackets
operator-source identity reduced to rank-two L2 or Route-C residual fill
rank-two L2 cohomology validates with h1 = 8
selected nonzero non-exact Ext input for V_alpha
reduced/global AH stability enumeration
reflexive-hull reduction and conditional Li-Yau/Gauduchon HYM bridge
selected equal-radius Gauduchon metric from rho_UV/constants branch
V_alpha stability at equal radius in the selected AH layer
abstract HYM existence bridge for selected V_alpha
```

This repairs a real blocker: the rank-two arithmetic/Ext lane is no longer the
thing stopping operator-source identity. The next gate is the value-emission
gate:

```text
selected HYM connection/operator values
same-source Chern-Weil/Green-Schwarz row
same-source rho_E, D_E, Riesz/Green, and dotD
operator-layer Pic0 or holonomy-sensitive quotient
primitive C1 contractions
A_selected and b_selected

## Route-C HYM Operator Values Gate Import

The selected HYM operator-values gate is now imported.

What closes:

```text
abstract HYM existence is no longer the blocker
honest smoke mesh/metric/sector-map checks pass
honest operator checks fail selected-source flags
lifted-flag operator checks pass only as schema sufficiency diagnostics
the missing extraction theorem is identified
```

What remains open:

selected HYM connection/transition values

## Selected HYM Connection to Finite Operator Extraction Spec

The missing extraction theorem is now an executable contract.

It must derive, from the selected equal-radius HYM connection on the selected
`V_alpha` branch:

```text
selected connection / transition representative
finite quotient, basis, truncation, and error bounds
rho_E mesh and metric tables
sector maps
D_E action matrices
Riesz projectors and complement gaps
reduced Green operators
dotD_alpha1 same-branch derivative
primitive C1 overlap contractions
theorem-derived selected-source flags
```

The existing Route-C validators are the acceptance tests. A successful packet
must pass them honestly, without lifted selected flags and without observed
flavor, mass, mixing, CP, threshold, or benchmark inputs.

The exact status is:

```text
SELECTED_HYM_CONNECTION_TO_FINITE_OPERATOR_EXTRACTION_SPEC_BUILT_VALUES_OPEN

## Selected HYM Connection to Finite Operator Extraction Run

The first extraction run was executed against the current honest finite inputs.

Passing validators:

```text
rhoE_mesh
rhoE_metric
sector_maps
```

Failing validators:

```text
route_c_residuals
D_E action
Riesz/gap
reduced Green
dotD alpha1 response
```

The failures are source/provenance failures, not algebraic shape failures:
selected-source and alpha1-driver flags are not theorem-derived on the current
honest inputs. Lifted flags remain forbidden as proof.

Thus this run does not emit selected finite operator values and cannot promote
`A_selected` or `b_selected`.

## Selected HYM Extraction Theorem Insertions

The extraction gate is now converted into paper-ready theorem text for the
contexts where the result belongs:

```text
proof_corpus/paper_insertions/Selected_HYM_Connection_Extraction_Theorem_for_Strominger_Paper.md
proof_corpus/paper_insertions/RouteC_Aselected_Extraction_Guardrail_for_Theta_Papers.md
```

The Strominger/HYM insertion states the selected connection-to-finite-operator
extraction criterion: finite Route-C operator values are selected exactly when
the selected connection/transition representative, finite quotient/basis,
`rho_E`, metric, sector maps, `D_E`, Riesz/gap, reduced Green, same-branch
`dotD_alpha1`, primitive C1 contractions, and theorem-derived source flags are
emitted from the same selected HYM source and pass the validators honestly.

The Theta/Route-C insertion states the promotion guardrail: conditional
Weyl-pair and C1 systems may remain algebraic diagnostics, but they cannot be
promoted to `A_selected`, `b_selected`, selected Yukawa data, selected mixing
data, or selected CP data until the extraction criterion passes.

Both insertions include the current honest-packet no-go corollary. They also
explicitly forbid abstract HYM existence, lifted selected flags, smoke packets,
observed masses/mixings, CKM/PMNS inputs, CP phases, thresholds, benchmark
matrices, and fitted constants as promotion sources.

The exact status is:

The next executable artifact remains:

MTT_Selected_HYM_SelectedConnection_or_RouteC_SelectedResidual_ValueSolve_v1

## Selected HYM Value Solve Attempt

The value solve is now attempted against the current cross-repo evidence.

Imported support:

```text
selected extraction criterion
gauge-fixed rank-2 HYM equation system
finite Newton/Galerkin solve contract
27-mode B_N/qutrit execution scaffold
q79 Phi_fin alpha1 finite codomain and support checks
```

Attempted routes:

```text
direct selected HYM connection representative
finite Newton/Galerkin solve
Route-C residual bypass
Phi_fin alpha1 payload emission
rank-2-to-sector transfer
```

The attempt closes negatively. The current artifacts do not emit a selected
`A_HYM` or Hermitian endomorphism coefficient vector, gauge-fixed residual
values, coercivity/truncation certificate, rank-2-to-sector operator functor, or
proof-usable selected `D_E`, Riesz/Green, `dotD`, and primitive C1 payload.
Formal lifted flags and smoke packets remain rejected as proof.

## Selected HYM Adjoint Transfer and First Coefficient Solve

The value-solve gate advances through the canonical adjoint carrier.

Since `det(V_alpha)=L tensor L^-1` is trivial, the rank-2 selected HYM source
has a canonical rank-3 operator carrier:

```text
Ad(V_alpha)=End_0(V_alpha)
```

A selected HYM connection `A` induces the adjoint connection `ad(A)`, and the
curvature transfers by:

```text
F_ad(A)=ad(F_A)
```

This closes the abstract rank-2-to-rank-3 transfer functor without introducing
a continuous parameter. The first adjoint-Galerkin coefficient solve is then
attempted. The algebraic `su(2)` adjoint matrices are emitted, and the current
unknown manifest is fixed:

```text
Hermitian metric endomorphism coefficients: 81
connection one-form coefficients:          486
total connection-form solve slots:          567
```

The selected coefficients still do not emit. The present blocker is no longer a
rank mismatch; it is the absence of a selected `End_0(V_alpha)` finite
basis/differential table, or a proof that the current 27-mode `B_N` scaffold is
that selected finite basis. The 8-slot Cech/Ext vector remains a cohomology
selector, not a connection coefficient vector.

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_End0_Basis_Differential_Table_or_BN_Identification_v1

## Selected End0 Basis Table or BN Identification Import

The End0 table gate has now been imported and sharpened.

Path A, identifying the current 27-mode `B_N` scaffold with the selected
`End_0(V_alpha)` finite table, is rejected. The reason is categorical, not
numerical: `B_N` is gerbe-twisted/projective scaffold data, while
`End_0(V_alpha)` is ordinary adjoint bundle data after `V_alpha` is fixed.
Dimension agreement and the three-dimensional zero cluster remain useful
support, but they do not prove table identity.

Path B is retained as the rigorous route:

```text
selected AH/Appell-Humbert data
selected Ext local forms
selected HYM connection terms
ordinary End_0(V_alpha) local basis and differential table
```

The selected ordered Chern/H1 layer and the explicit Appell-Humbert automorphy
formula are present. What remains is the operator-level local-form table:
selected Ext representatives, Pic0/holonomy resolution beyond the curvature
quotient, selected `A_HYM`, End0 local basis, Hodge/Lambda, quadrature, and
gauge-projector tables.

The exact status is:

```text

```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_End0_Direct_Differential_Table_From_AH_Ext_Forms_v1
```

## Selected End0 Direct AH/Ext Form Table Import

The direct `End_0(V_alpha)` construction now has a symbolic local-form bridge
from the selected AH/Ext side:

```text
eta = theta_plus_0(z1) tensor eta_minus_0(z2) dbar_z2
```

This is the first Ext slot `theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_0` in the selected
`H^1(X,L^2)` packet. The Appell-Humbert seed is `L^2=(2,-4,0)`, and the central
shared-circle degree is zero.

The partial operator template is:

```text
barpartial_End0 = barpartial_Iwasawa + ad(A_split_AH + eta_offdiag + HYM_correction)
```

This is a real advance, but not a selected numerical table. The Ext form still
needs theta normalization, local overlap/trivialization data or an equivalent
Dolbeault representative, and Hermitian normalization. The HYM correction,
Hodge/Lambda, quadrature, and gauge projectors also remain open.

The exact status is:

```text
SELECTED_END0_DIRECT_AH_EXT_FORM_TABLE_IMPORTED_NORMALIZED_EXT_TABLE_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_Normalized_Ext_Local_Form_Table_v1
```

## Selected Normalized Ext Local Form Table

The selected Ext class has now been normalized in the terminal
Cech/Appell-Humbert basis. The selected coordinate table is:

```text
theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_0 -> 1
theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_1 -> 0
theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_2 -> 0
theta_plus_0_tensor_eta_minus_3 -> 0
theta_plus_1_tensor_eta_minus_0 -> 0
theta_plus_1_tensor_eta_minus_1 -> 0
theta_plus_1_tensor_eta_minus_2 -> 0
theta_plus_1_tensor_eta_minus_3 -> 0
```

The local representative remains:

```text
eta = theta_plus_0(z1) tensor eta_minus_0(z2) dbar_z2
```

The transition weights are:

```text
L^2 = (2,-4,0)
E(g1,g2)=2
E(g3,g4)=-4
E(g5,g6)=0
```

This closes the normalized selected Ext coordinate/local-form table. It still
does not supply analytic theta samples, a harmonic or partition-of-unity
Dolbeault table, selected HYM correction, Hodge/Lambda, quadrature, or gauge
projectors.

The exact status is:

```text
SELECTED_NORMALIZED_EXT_LOCAL_FORM_TABLE_BUILT_HYM_HODGE_QUADRATURE_OPEN
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_End0_HYM_Hodge_Quadrature_Projector_Table_v1
```

## Selected End0 HYM/Hodge/Quadrature/Projector Table

The equal-radius Hodge/Lambda contractions and exact theta quadrature
normalization are now part of the End0 chain.

The selected Ext row has:

```text
||eta_00||^2 = 1/sqrt(32)
eta_00^unit = 32^(1/4) * eta_00
```

The contraction table fixes:

```text
Lambda(i*ea wedge ebar_b) = delta_ab
Lambda(i*e1 wedge ebar1 - i*e2 wedge ebar2) = 0
Lambda(i*e2 wedge ebar2 - i*e3 wedge ebar3) = 0
```

So the direct End0 operator template becomes:

```text
barpartial_End0 = barpartial_Iwasawa + ad(A_split_AH + eta_00^unit + HYM_correction)
```

This is still not a selected Newton table. The selected nonabelian HYM
correction coefficients, metric endomorphism coefficients, gauge projector
values, and full oriented Hodge-star/wedge sign table remain open.

The exact status is:

The next executable artifact is:

```text
MTT_Selected_HYM_Correction_and_Gauge_Projector_Value_Table_v1

## Selected HYM Correction and Gauge Projector Value Table

The first selected HYM value packet is now available on the direct End0 route.
It imports the `eta_00^unit` row-level overlap/Hodge/projector table and the
first trace-free HYM correction solve.

The row-level projector is:

```text
P_eta_00(v)=<eta_00^unit,v> eta_00^unit
matrix on <eta_00, complement> = [[1,0],[0,0]]
```

The first correction solves:

```text
rho = |eta_00^unit|^2
mean(rho) = 0.9999999999999997
Delta phi = rho - 1, mean(phi)=0
||Delta phi - (rho - 1)||_L2 = 5.588e-16
S_1 = phi * T3
```

Thus the same selected branch now fixes the first trace-free diagonal End0
direction, `T3`, without observed or benchmark inputs. This is deliberately
only a first-value theorem: the row projector cannot be promoted to the full
connection-space gauge projector, and the Poisson correction cannot be promoted
to the full nonlinear HYM connection.

MTT_Selected_Full_ExpS_HYM_Newton_Replay_v1

## Selected Scalar ExpS HYM Newton Replay

The scalar diagonal `exp(S)` replay is now computed on the selected same-branch
theta grid. Under the ansatz

```text
S = s*T3
H = exp(S)
rho = |eta_00^unit|^2
```

the finite selected equation is:

```text
Delta s + rho*exp(-2s) - mean(rho*exp(-2s)) = 0
mean(s)=0
```

The replay converges with:

```text
mesh = 24^4
residual_L2 = 9.887e-13
||s||_L2 = 0.02743487456065332
min(s), max(s) = -0.03750848523255589, 0.06968059291319133
```

On the zero-mean finite grid, the Jacobian is coercive with lower bound
`(2*pi)^2`: its quadratic form is `||grad v||^2 + 2 int rho exp(-2s) v^2`.

This closes a real nonlinear selected value solve. The remaining gate is no
longer the scalar replay itself, but the proof that this scalar diagonal replay
lifts to the full selected HYM operator payload with continuum truncation
control and a full connection-space gauge projector.

The exact status is:

MTT_Selected_ScalarExpS_to_Full_HYM_Operator_Lift_v1

## Selected Scalar ExpS to Full HYM Row Model Lift

The scalar diagonal replay now lifts to the full finite HYM equation in the
selected one-row Appell-Humbert row model.

The selected holomorphic structure is triangular:

```text
barpartial_V = [[barpartial_L, eta_00^unit], [0, barpartial_L^-1]]
```

The selected determinant-one metric is:

```text
S = s*T3
H = exp(S)=diag(exp(s), exp(-s))
det(H)=1
```

The proof is a three-part reduction:

```text
off-diagonal HYM residual = 0
central trace residual = 0
trace-free diagonal residual = scalar exp(S) replay residual
```

The off-diagonal part is zero because `eta_00^unit` is harmonic in the selected
row model. The central trace is zero by determinant one. The trace-free
diagonal part is exactly the scalar equation already solved:

```text
Delta s + |eta_00^unit|^2 exp(-2s)
  - mean(|eta_00^unit|^2 exp(-2s)) = 0
```

Thus the full finite row-model HYM residual is:

```text

```

This proves the HYM lift at the selected row-model level. It does not yet emit
the downstream finite derivative basis, continuum truncation certificate, full
connection-space gauge projector, or validator-ready `rhoE/D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD`
payload.

## Selected Diagonal HYM Operator Payload Extraction

The proved row-model HYM solution now emits a selected rank-2 metric and
connection payload:

```text
H = diag(exp(s), exp(-s))
A_diag = d s * T3
```

The determinant-one condition and residual check are executable:

```text
max |det(H)-1| = 1.110e-16
||Delta s + rho exp(-2s)-mean(rho exp(-2s))||_L2 = 9.887e-13
||d s||_L2 = 0.226246764797685
```

The central shared-circle/`z3` direction remains zero because the selected
`eta_00` row has shared-circle factor one and no `z3` dependence.

This is the selected rank-2 diagonal source payload for the next End0 operator
extraction. It is not yet validator-ready `rhoE/D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD` data.

## Selected End0 DE Payload From Diagonal HYM

The rank-2 diagonal HYM connection now induces the selected End0 differential
operator:

```text
A_diag = d s * T3
D_E = d + ad(A_diag)
D_a = partial_a I_3 + (partial_a s) ad(T3)
```

on the real adjoint basis:

```text
['T1', 'T2', 'T3']
ad(T3) = [[0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
```

The induced connection is nontrivial in the active `x1,y1,x2,y2` theta
directions and zero in the shared-circle/`z3` directions. This closes the
diagonal End0 `D_E` formula and directionwise matrix payload. It is deliberately
not a qutrit/sector promotion, and it does not identify the projective `B_N`
scaffold with the selected End0 basis.

The exact status is:

```text
SELECTED_END0_DE_DIAGONAL_PAYLOAD_BUILT_RIESZ_DOTD_TRANSFER_OPEN
```

## Selected Riesz Green dotD From Diagonal End0 DE

The protected diagonal `T3` lane now supplies the first selected
Riesz/Green/dotD packet. Because

```text
D_E = d + ad(d s * T3)
ad(T3)T3 = 0
```

the covariant problem reduces on scalar fields tensor `T3` to the ordinary
positive scalar operator:

```text
P0[f*T3] = mean(f) * T3
G = (-Delta)^(-1) on zero-mean scalar fields tensor T3
dotD_a[h] = (partial_a h) ad(T3)
```

The finite-grid certificate checks:

```text
lambda_1(-Delta) = 39.478417604357
||G|| <= 0.025330295910584444
```

and writes the deterministic Green residual into the certificate. This closes
only the protected diagonal lane and the formal Frechet formula. The coupled
`T1/T2` covariant Green, physical `dotD_alpha1`, rank2-to-sector transfer, and
offdiagonal End0 control remain open.

The exact status is:

```

## Selected T1T2 Covariant Green

The coupled `T1/T2` block now closes in the diagonal HYM branch. With the
complex coordinate `w = u + i v`, the induced connection is:

```text
D w = d w + i d s w
z = exp(i s) w
D w = exp(-i s) d z
```

Therefore the two-real-dimensional parallel kernel is generated by
`exp(-i s)` and `i exp(-i s)`, and the reduced covariant Green is:

```text
Pker[f] = exp(-i s) mean(exp(i s) f)
G12[f] = exp(-i s) (-Delta)^(-1)(exp(i s)f - mean(exp(i s)f))
```

The finite certificate checks:

```text
lambda_1 = 39.478417604357
||G12|| <= 0.025330295910584444
```

This closes the coupled `T1/T2` reduced Green in gauge-normal form. It does not
yet emit rank2-to-sector transfer values, physical `dotD_alpha1`, or
offdiagonal End0 control.

The exact status is:

## Selected Rank2 to Rank3 Transfer or Physical dotD alpha1

The abstract rank2-to-rank3 adjoint transfer closes:

```text
A |-> ad(A)
F_A |-> ad(F_A)
End_0(V_alpha) has basis T1,T2,T3 and rank 3
continuous parameters added = 0
```

This means the rank mismatch is no longer a source of a free parameter. The
selected diagonal HYM branch now supplies End0 operator response data before a
sector functor is applied.

The finite sector values still do not close. The `B_N`/qutrit scaffold remains
projective and diagnostic, not the selected ordinary End0 table. Likewise,
PhiFin/Route-C `dotD_alpha1` matrices have useful `27x27` shapes, but the
physical alpha1 driver and selected source values remain absent.

## Selected SectorFunctor or Physical Alpha1 SourceValues

The direct ordinary sector functor from selected End0 to the current 27-mode
`B_N` sector basis is ruled out:

```text
End_0(V_alpha) basis T1,T2,T3 -> 27-mode B_N/qutrit sector basis
```

The obstruction is the nontrivial projective cocycle:

```text
ordinary End0 commutator phase = 1
B_N projective commutator phase = [-0.5, -0.866025403784]
```

Since a functor preserving ordinary End0 equivariance cannot change the
2-cocycle class, identifying this `B_N` basis with ordinary End0 would collapse
the verified projective phase to `1`. Thus the positive path must include a
gerbe-twisted/central-extension sector functor, or derive physical
`dotD_alpha1` source values directly.

## Selected Physical dotD alpha1 SourceValues

The direct physical `dotD_alpha1` route has been tested and reduced to:

```text
SelectedPhiFinAlpha1Payload
```

This is now the common missing object for both selected-source promotion and the
alpha1-driver promotion. The route does not yet emit values:

```text
evaluated_grad_V_C1_alpha1_source_vector = null
A_selected emitted = false
b_selected emitted = false
same-branch dotD_alpha1 derivative = open
```

The existing alpha1 driver row and `27x27` `dotD_alpha1` matrices remain
diagnostic support, not selected physical values.

The next executable artifact is:

```text

## Selected PhiFin Alpha1 Payload Value Emission

The missing `SelectedPhiFinAlpha1Payload` now has a stronger closed prefix:

```text
same-basis finite dotD_alpha1 value matrices = present
sector projectors = clean
selected D_E / Riesz / Green gap layer = locked input
```

This imports nonzero finite `dotD_alpha1` matrices in the same
`F3xF3_gerbe_twisted_fourier_N1_rank3` basis. It still does not close the
physical payload, because honest replay fails exactly at source/driver
promotion:

```text
selected_dotD_source_verified = false
alpha1_driver_verified = false
A_selected emitted = false
b_selected emitted = false
```

Thus the next theorem must prove the selected dotD source and same-branch
alpha1 driver before any C1 response matrices or physical alpha1 source values
can be emitted.

## Selected dotD alpha1 Source Driver Reduction

The selected `dotD_alpha1` source and same-branch alpha1 driver theorem is not
proved yet, but the cut set is now much sharper. The remaining obstruction is
not a matrix, gap, projector, or source-level gerbe-support problem. Those are
already available as support.

The exact missing object is:

```text
Selected_alpha1_Tangent_or_Retarded_Overlap_Kernel
```

It must emit the selected tangent or retarded-overlap derivative that proves
the existing `dotD_alpha1` matrices are the derivative of the selected PhiFin
source itself, not a diagnostic source-lift.

The exact status is:

```text
SELECTED_DOTD_ALPHA1_SOURCE_DRIVER_REDUCED_TO_TANGENT_OR_RETARDED_KERNEL
```

The next executable artifact is:

```text
Selected_alpha1_Tangent_or_Retarded_Overlap_Kernel_v1

## Selected alpha1 Tangent or Retarded Overlap Kernel Construct

The finite alpha1 tangent kernel is now constructed:

```text
h = h_ext
dotD_h = (dh) ad(T3)
delta psi = -(h ad(T3)) psi_sel
D_sel(delta psi) + dotD_h psi_sel = 0
```

The canonical L2 dual normalization is also constructed:

```text
N_alpha1(f) = <f,h_ext> / ||h_ext||_L2^2
N_alpha1(h_ext) = 1
lambda_alpha1 candidate = 1
```

This closes the algebraic tangent-kernel construct and pins the current unit
candidate. It does not yet close physical alpha1, because the same-source
branch must still emit the selected source-strength coordinate or selected
normalization functional.

The exact status is:

```text
SELECTED_ALPHA1_TANGENT_KERNEL_CONSTRUCTED_SELECTION_NORMALIZATION_OPEN

The next executable artifact is:

## Physical alpha1 Normalization NoGo and End0-Sector Reduction

The direct source-strength route is closed as a no-go for naive Ext scaling.
Continuous scaling inside a fixed rank-two extension class does not vary the
integral Chern/source row:

```text
c2(V_alpha) = 4 alpha1
```

The shared circle remains degree-zero. Therefore physical alpha1 must now be
carried by the remaining legal route: a selected End0-to-sector
functor/source/value packet with theorem-derived transfer normalization.

```text

## Sector ZeroMode End0 TensorProduct Construct

The End0-to-sector carrier is constructed as six adjoint triplets plus one
Higgs singlet:

```text
Q,u,d,L,e,N: rho_s(T_i)=ad(T_i)
H: rho_H(T_i)=0
rank = 6*3 + 1 = 19
```

The projectors are orthogonal/idempotent, commute with the End0 action, and
sum to identity. This closes the algebraic carrier and representation-choice
part of the sector functor. The selected zero-mode source action, selected
Gram normalization, matter-slot routing, and honest dotD replay remain open.

```text

```

Next:

```text
MTT_Selected_SectorZeroMode_SourcePayload_Search_or_Emission_Attempt_v1

## Sector ZeroMode SourcePayload Stationary Promotion

The End0 sector carrier is now promoted to a selected stationary source
payload by importing the transported finite-projector theorem:

```text
P_s^sel = U P_s^model U^-1
U = exp(-u ad(T3))
Q,u,d,L,e,N: validator-ready rank-3 rho_s
H: validator-ready rank-1 singlet rho_H=0
```

This closes the legal stationary/projector source map needed after the carrier
construction. The proof uses exact gauge transport, so the raw untransported
27-mode packet remains unpromoted. The open frontier is now the true dynamic
one: include the transport derivative in `dotD_alpha1`, derive the alpha1
driver/source-strength normalization, and then route the matter slots and C1
overlap contractions.

```text

Next:

```text
MTT_Selected_dotD_alpha1_TransportDerivative_and_Driver_v1

## dotD alpha1 TransportDerivative Import

The dynamic transport formula is now in the local proof chain:

```text
U = exp(-u ad(T3))
dU/dalpha = -(du/dalpha) ad(T3) U
dotD_h = (dh) ad(T3)
delta psi = -(h ad(T3)) psi_sel
D_sel(delta psi) + dotD_h psi_sel = 0
```

This closes the operator algebra needed to differentiate the transported
stationary packet. The finite `dotD_alpha1` matrices are mathematically ready
once the alpha1 driver is theorem-derived. The proof deliberately keeps
`alpha1_driver_verified` false until a same-source source-strength
normalization theorem identifies `h_ext` with the physical alpha1 derivative.

MTT_Selected_Alpha1_SourceStrength_Normalization_or_Driver_Theorem_v1

## Alpha1 SourceStrength Normalization Gate

The local alpha1-driver problem is now reduced to a selected-source emission
gate. The branch isolates the conditional candidate:

```text
lambda_alpha1 candidate = 1
du/dalpha1 candidate = h_ext
h_ext residual L2 = 6.751979459438445e-13
```

All required same-source packet fields were filled as candidates, but none were
emitted as selected theorem-derived values. The final validator therefore fails
for the right reason: the data are still support-only, coordinate-convention
only, or diagnostic-lift. The two remaining legal routes are a selected
same-source source-identity/normalization value or a typed B_N retarded
alpha1 kernel.

Next:

MTT_Selected_SameSource_Alpha1_Normalization_SourceIdentity_or_RetardedKernel_Value_v1
```

## Alpha1 Driver Replay Closure Chain

The last alpha1-driver blocker is closed by importing the U1/Y Route-C theorem
chain:

```text
source_identity = selected
stationary HYM/projector replay = closed
ordered terminal orientation = u,e phase and d,nuD shift
functional operator blocks = emitted for u,d,e,nuD
overlap normalization = rho_s(T_i)/sqrt(2)
N_alpha1(h_ext) = 1
du/dalpha1 = h_ext
selected_dotD_source_verified = true
alpha1_driver_verified = true
honest dotD replay = PASS
```

The closure is theorem-derived from terminal orientation, functional
operator-emission/overlap normalization, and the transport derivative. It does
not use observed constants, benchmark entries, locked C1 columns, or diagnostic
flag lifting.

Status:

```text
ALPHA1_DRIVER_REPLAY_CLOSED_PRIMITIVE_C1_LAMBDA_OPEN
```

The post-alpha frontier is now sharply separated:

```text
24 primitive C1 atoms for u,d,e,nuD
A_selected and b_selected
selected lambda_12 spectral/local-determinant table
Yukawa magnitudes and full SM closure
```

Next:

```text
Selected_U1Y_RouteC_PrimitiveC1_AtomEmission_or_SelectedLambda12_SpectralTable_v1
```

## PostAlpha SourceValue Lambda Frontier

The remaining post-alpha SM/flavor closure has been reduced to two value
objects. The primitive C1 object must emit, from one selected source, the 24
atom matrices, 12 selected sector bases, and four `b_selected` rows or
homogeneous-zero theorems. The route partition is exact: selected noninvariant
primitive tensor, selected canonical zero theorem, or typed monad/Cech/HYM
derivation of one of those outcomes.

For `lambda_12`, the U1 quotient projector is accepted only as carrier/index
data, not as a local determinant operator. The central-circle determinant is
also not importable for U1 after the shared circle is quotiented out. Thus the
remaining honest object is a selected U1/hypercharge local-determinant
spectrum on `V/<s>`.

## PostAlpha Candidate Routes

The primitive C1 path now has finite nonzero candidate support: the minimal
noninvariant active shift `(1,1)` emits four candidate matrix families
corresponding to fiber shifts `0`, `1`, `2`, and `all`. These candidates use no
observed flavor data, but remain unselected. They are computational evidence for
the primary noninvariant primitive route, not selected proof data.

The `lambda_12` path now has its source-packet interface and
section-ring/twisted-module row reduction imported. The finite qutrit lane
closes only the quotient index; a selected operator row still needs positive
eigenvalues, multiplicities, hypercharge/index weights, and finite determinant
prescription from the same source.

## PostAlpha FiberClass SourceTarget

The C1 source-selection route has been sharpened again. Among all active deck
shifts, `(1,1)` is the unique nonzero one-response C1 shift. The fixed qutrit
fiber shifts `0`, `1`, and `2` form one current-layer cyclic gauge class, while
the `all` envelope is retired as a fixed single-charge primitive. Therefore
shift `0` may be used only as a computation gauge for current spectral
invariants.

This does not close flavor physics. Current-layer fixed-fiber matrices have
degenerate singular values, so full flavor splitting still needs selected
higher-order/full-response data or a same-branch basis-transport/vertex source
theorem.

## PostAlpha WeylPair Transfer Reduction

The primitive-only source theorem has a counterexample: the fixed-fiber
primitive span, even with the all-fiber envelope, does not contain the locked
qutrit/Weyl splitter target. This does not invalidate active shift `(1,1)`; it
shows that the selected source must be enriched by a phase-like basis-holonomy
component.

The enriched Weyl-pair packet is algebraically sufficient. A phase-like `Z`
column routed to `u,e` as `I+Z` and a shift-like `X` column routed to `d,nuD`
as `I+X` give a rank-two conditional operator solving the locked splitter with
`deltaTheta=(1,1)` up to roundoff. Source-level `Z/X` carrier provenance and
active-shift provenance are closed; the source-to-C1 transfer is exact
conditioned on sector routing.

The remaining open theorem is selected sector routing and normalization from
the same source. Until that is emitted, the Weyl-pair operator remains
conditional and cannot be called `A_selected`.

## PostAlpha SectorRouting SourcePacket

The Weyl-pair sector route has been reduced to a source-packet problem. The
locked conditional columns uniquely pick `Z -> u,e` and `X -> d,nuD`, but this
uniqueness is diagnostic only. It cannot be used as selected source proof.

The SU(5)/E6 matter-slot dictionary gives structural support: `u,e` sit on the
`10_M` phase/clock side, while `d` and conditional `nuD` sit on the non-10 /
singlet shift side. The remaining gaps are the selected `nuD` singlet rule,
selected transfer normalization, selected overlap functor, and same-source
Galerkin/operator payload.

## PostAlpha Hybrid SameSource NoGo

The hybrid Galerkin packet has been imported as a strict same-source
fill/no-go. In this local repo, alpha1 and honest dotD replay are already
closed, so the result is not an alpha regression. It is a post-alpha C1/overlap
no-go for the current source record: seven fields are required, zero are
selected emissions, six have support only, and no mathematical impossibility is
claimed.

The first dependency is the source identity bridge, followed by operator
values, matter/overlap payload, and primitive contractions. Only when those
subpackets pass as selected, theorem-derived, same-source data may `A_selected`,
`b_selected`, and the selected splitter solve be recomputed.

## PostAlpha OperatorSourceIdentity Pic0Split

The source-identity bridge has been reduced one layer further. Source-level
S3/Green-Schwarz/projective support is retained, but it does not emit an
operator-level visible source identity. Pic0 selection or quotient is necessary
as a side condition, yet cannot by itself emit the residual, `D_E`,
Riesz/Green, `dotD`, or C1 payload.

The primary next object is therefore `Phi_fin`, the selected finite emission
morphism. It must convert `selected_source_verified` from a flag into a theorem
field and feed the finite validators from one source.

## PostAlpha PhiFin Subpacket

`Phi_fin` has reached the actual finite payload layer. The domain lock and
finite trace scaffold are present, but the trace is still not selected source
data. The selected finite basis, commuting projection square, theorem-derived
`selected_source_verified`, selected operator payload, gap/error certificate,
and primitive C1 tensors all remain open.

This is useful because it shifts the work from abstract source identity to a
specific finite-trace source/no-go gate.

## PostAlpha SelectedFiniteTrace

The selected finite-trace gate now rejects the old identity `rho_E` smoke trace
and promotes the smooth 27-mode packet only as the strongest current prefix.
This prefix contains nonidentity projective `rho_E` support, a 27-mode `B_N`
scaffold, same-basis `D_E`/Riesz/Green/`dotD` values, sector projectors, the
canonical C1 zero-response no-go, and a first HYM correction.

It still does not close `Phi_fin`: selected trace equality, full selected
Iwasawa/Strominger operator formula, selected gap/error certificate, and
theorem-derived selected-source flags remain open.

## PostAlpha TraceEquals27Mode

The selected trace equality for the emitted 27-mode `D_E` is now imported as a
scoped theorem. It closes the `D_E` gap/Riesz/Green layer with `eta_N=1`, gap
lower bound `2.386490844928603`, and Green norm bound
`0.4190252822989217`.

This closure is deliberately narrow. It does not by itself emit primitive C1,
`A_selected`, `b_selected`, `lambda_12`, or full `Phi_fin`. In this repo the
alpha1 driver and honest dotD replay are already closed, so the remaining live
part is selected primitive/non-invariant C1 payload emission.

## PostAlpha dotD alpha1 C1 Response

The post-alpha dotD/C1 response packet is now reconciled against the later
local alpha1 closure. The sibling U1/Y packet remains valid as a C1-response
reduction: it does not emit `A_selected`, `b_selected`, sector response
matrices, `lambda_12`, Yukawa magnitudes, or full SM closure. But its
alpha-open fields are superseded by the local oriented-overlap theorem, which
has already closed `alpha1_driver_verified`, `selected_dotD_source_verified`,
and honest dotD replay without lifted flags.

This moves the live proof target from alpha1 tangent construction to selected
primitive C1 payload construction: primitive/non-invariant C1 contractions,
selected Hess_Xi finite blocks, zero-mode bases with Gram-Schmidt, and sector
response matrices.

## PostAlpha PrimitiveC1 SourceValue Frontier

The primitive C1 response gate is now at a selected source-value frontier. The
assembly theorem fixes the required atom structure: for each sector
`u,d,e,nuD`, the payload must emit theta-overlap variation, left/right/Higgs
zero-mode responses, explicit vertex, and basis-connection terms. That is 24
primitive atom matrices, plus selected bases and a selected inhomogeneous row
or homogeneous-zero theorem.

The current corpus fill/no-go fills zero atom matrices and leaves 40 source
leaves open. The canonical translation-invariant zero branch is finitely
tested, but cannot yet be promoted as the selected C1 payload. The route
ranking is therefore:

```text
1. selected non-invariant primitive C1 tensor
2. canonical zero selection plus homogeneous b row
3. typed monad/Cech/HYM connection derivation values

## PostAlpha ExternalNonInvariantC1

The external non-invariant C1 candidate packet sharpens the live route. The
primitive C1 tensor is not arbitrary: finite support forces active shift
`(1,1)`, all four fixed-fiber candidates are nonzero, and the all-fiber
envelope is retired as rank-one. The fixed fibers form one qutrit gauge class,
so none of the candidates can be promoted without a selector.

The next theorem must select an absolute fiber origin, prove that the
downstream C1/Yukawa observables are invariant under the fixed fiber class, or
derive the same basis transport from selected monad/Cech/Galerkin zero-mode
data.

## PostAlpha FiberClass C1Observable Quotient

The fiber-origin problem closes in quotient form for current primitive C1
spectral observables. Active shift `(1,1)` is selected at this layer, the fixed
fiber shifts `0,1,2` form one selected quotient class, and `fiber_shift_0` is a
legal computation representative for rank, determinant absolute value,
`YY*` traces, and singular spectrum.

This is not a hidden knob and not a full matrix selection. The quotient class
is scalar-permutation degenerate, so it cannot produce nondegenerate Yukawa
hierarchies, CKM/PMNS, CP, `b_selected`, `lambda_12`, or full SM closure.
Those remain higher-order/full-response or same-source operator-level
basis-transport tasks.

## PostAlpha PrimitiveClass NoSplit

The primitive fixed-fiber quotient class is now audited against flavor
splitting. Direct replay gives `Y_s Y_s* = c I` in `u,d,e,nuD`, with zero
traceless part, zero sector commutators, and zero CP-odd invariant at this
layer. Thus the primitive quotient class is useful for current spectral
observables but cannot generate nondegenerate Yukawa hierarchy, CKM/PMNS, or
CP by itself.

The proof target is now selected same-source higher-order/full-response matrix
emission, or selected operator-level basis transport.

## PostAlpha SelectedCorrectionEmission Reduction

The selected correction/full-response gate has no algebraic splitter
obstruction: a diagnostic qutrit/Weyl splitter passes mass-splitting,
commutator, and CP-odd tests without observed targets. But it is not a selected
source. Formal Galerkin lift is rejected as proof, primitive-only emission is
insufficient, and no same-source payload currently emits selected correction
matrices.

The gate is therefore reduced to same-source non-identity `rho_E` and
quotient-valid `B_N` construction, followed by honest selected
`deltaTheta/C1` emission.

## PostAlpha NonIdentity RhoE BN Interface

The selected correction/full-response route now has a strict non-identity
`rho_E` / quotient-valid `B_N` interface. The template keeps every selected
value open while requiring same-branch q79/F,m=1 source evidence, non-identity
twisted transition data, quotient-valid non-invariant basis data, honest
`D_E`/Riesz/Green/`dotD` replay, and selected `deltaTheta/C1` emission.

This interface explicitly prevents identity smoke payloads, diagnostic
splitters, formal Galerkin lift promotion, and premature `lambda_12` or flavor
claims. Existing conditional operator tables remain support/no-go data only.

## PostAlpha SelectedSource TypedDE Reduction

The fill attempt for non-identity `rho_E` and quotient-valid `B_N` is now
localized to the selected source/typed-DE witness layer. The existing finite
prefix has useful support data: a non-identity projective `rho_E` candidate,
27-mode `D_E`, same-basis `dotD`, canonical C1 engine, and first HYM-correction
values. None of these closes source provenance or selected witness values.

The typed monad route passes charge compatibility but lacks actual `f_i` and
`g_i` sections. The automorphy/section-ring route has a symbolic rank-one
relation but lacks automorphy factors, section bases, multiplication constants,
and a concrete `g after f = 0` exactness certificate. The next artifact must
print actual selected connection witness values or a rigorous no-go at that
layer.

## PostAlpha ConnectionWitness Contract Import

The selected connection witness gate is now narrowed to a machine-checkable
contract with exactly three legal value routes: typed monad/Cech data, direct
selected HYM/Strominger connection data, or finite Route-C solve data with
same-source provenance. The current payload has 29 missing leaves and therefore
does not compute the primitive C1 matrices, `A_selected`, `b_selected`,
`lambda_12`, or full SM closure.

This proves a negative/structural theorem: abstract HYM existence, typed charge
compatibility, and finite 27-mode prefix values cannot be used as proof unless
one legal payload route is filled.

## PostAlpha FiniteHYM DE Gap Promotion

The finite Route-C/HYM path now promotes the selected 27-mode `B_N`, `D_E`
gap, Riesz projection, and reduced Green layer. This is the first actual value
promotion after the witness contract:

```text
selected eta_N = 1.0
eta threshold = 2.1932454224643014
selected gap lower bound = 2.386490844928603
selected Green norm bound = 0.4190252822989217
```

The promotion is deliberately limited to the `D_E` gap layer. It does not
close `dotD_alpha1` source normalization, End0-sector routing, the full HYM
connection lift, primitive C1 contractions, `A_selected`, `b_selected`,
`lambda_12`, or full SM closure.

## PostAlpha dotD Source End0Routing Reduction

The `dotD_alpha1` source route is reduced to selected End0-to-sector functor
values. Route A, the tempting identification of continuous Ext-density scale
with alpha1 source normalization, is closed as a no-go: Ext scaling does not
vary the integral `c2(V_alpha)=4 alpha1` source row. The shared circle is
explicitly retained as degree-zero/trivial, so no hidden shared-circle charge is
used as a normalization knob.

Route B remains live: construct the selected functor from the `T1,T2,T3`
End0 row into the `Q,u,d,L,e,N,H` sector basis, including sector projectors,
selected routing/chirality table, and transfer normalization. Until this is
done, same-basis `dotD` matrices are support only.

## PostAlpha End0 Sector ModelValues Import

The End0-to-sector frontier now has canonical model values. The selected End0
domain basis is `T1,T2,T3`; six matter sectors `Q,u,d,L,e,N` carry adjoint
triplet action; `H` is the trivial singlet. The carrier rank is therefore
`6*3+1=19`, and the sector projectors are orthogonal, idempotent, sum to
identity, commute with the End0 action, and pass the `su(2)` bracket checks.

This is the precise way the older particle dictionary remains compatible with
the current proof chain. At support level:

```text
Q -> B3+B2+B1
u,d -> B3+B1
L -> B2+B1
e -> B1
N -> sterile/none
H -> B2+B1 support reuse
```

The theorem deliberately does not identify the 27-mode `B_N` carrier with a
literal particle list. It records a support match and a canonical sector carrier
model. The selected zero-mode bases `K_s`, selected source map `rho_s`,
matter-slot routing, `1_M` rule, transfer normalization, physical `dotD`,
primitive C1, and full SM closure remain open.

## PostAlpha ZeroModeBasis HYMProjector Theorem Import

The zero-mode promotion theorem is now explicit. If a same-source selected
HYM/Strominger, typed monad/Cech, or finite Route-C projector payload emits
sector projectors `P_s` and ordered zero-mode bases `K_s`, then the canonical
End0 carrier promotes uniquely to selected physical sector source maps:

```text
rho_s(T_i) = P_s rho(T_i) P_s restricted to K_s = im(P_s)
```

The result is strong but conditional. It proves the model-to-selected bridge
criterion and the exact acceptance tests; it does not yet emit selected
projectors, zero-mode bases, gaps, End0-equivariance values, Gram matrices,
matter-slot routing, the `1_M` rule, transfer normalization, physical `dotD`,
primitive C1, or full SM closure.
