# MTT True SM Closure Master Plan - Full Repo Synthesis v1

Status: planning artifact, not a closure proof.

Update note: this v1 plan is superseded on the alpha1/dotD frontier by
`MTT_TrueSMClosure_CrossRepo_Status_Audit_v1.md`. The latest QA/SU3 U1/Y
Route-C results close theorem-derived `alpha1_driver_verified`,
`selected_dotD_source_verified`, `du/dalpha1=h_ext`, and honest dotD replay.
The active frontier after importing those results is the 24 primitive C1 atom
table plus selected lambda12/local determinant table, not a generic alpha1/dotD
or broad Route-C solve gate.

Generated from the current `mtt-sm-parity-closure` fast verifier plus latest
cross-repo signals from:

- `mtt-q79-proof-repro`
- `mtt-nonsm-constants-no-knob`
- `mtt-protospinor-gr-response-proof`
- the active MTT paper/corpus folders under `TEXPAPERS`

The goal is to stop loop drift. This plan separates selected closure, admitted
external replay, support-only scaffolds, and genuinely open computation.

## 0. Non-negotiable rule

Do not re-open a blocker if a later validator-backed packet supersedes it.

Before any future frontier statement:

1. Search for stronger packets with matching objects.
2. Promote them if validator/audit-backed.
3. Invalidate them explicitly if not promotable.
4. Only then name the frontier.

The active anti-loop closures are:

- Step 14/15 promotes `SelectedFiniteC1SourceIdentityTheorem`,
  `PhysicalPhiFinC1ActionSource`, `A_selected`, `b_selected`, and
  `deltaTheta_C1`.
- Step 16 retires the stale unpatched source-identity blocker for active
  internal scalar-row closure.
- Step 17 retires `P_s/K_s` stationary projector promotion and stationary
  `rho_s` as active blockers.

## 1. Current selected ledger

### 1.1 Closed at selected/source tier

These should not be repeated as proof frontiers:

- source identity stack:
  - `SelectedFiniteC1SourceIdentityTheorem`
  - `PhysicalPhiFinC1ActionSource`
  - `A_selected`
  - `b_selected`
  - `deltaTheta_C1`
- postsource alpha1/static matter support:
  - postsource alpha1 driver imported at postsource tier
  - static U10/Ubar5/1M readout imported
- dynamic first response:
  - same-source dynamic matter/overlap packet
  - dynamic Qa/SU3 first-response replay
  - qualitative splitting/mixing/CP tests
- Rtheta domain:
  - selected Rtheta source/domain
  - ten scalar-row codomain
  - no-knob kernel typed at readiness 8/9
- post-Pi external replay:
  - seven threshold rows admitted at external replay tier
  - three mass-scheme rows admitted at external replay tier
  - accepted diagonal profile theorem at external replay tier
- full-S2 source support:
  - transported stationary projectors `P_s/K_s`
  - validator-ready stationary `rho_s`
  - source-level projective S3 gerbe `rho_E`
  - End0 representation-choice ambiguity retired
  - sector Gram ambiguity conditionally retired

### 1.2 Closed only at admitted replay/support tier

These are useful, but not no-knob predictions:

- measured/common-scale Yukawa/Higgs tables
- threshold/mass-scheme rows
- diagonal profile fit/replay
- covariance/profile scaffolds
- precision/local-QFT comparison tables
- q79 central/charge branch evidence
- constants-program determinant/threshold/operator candidates

Rule: these may be used to validate or compare after source-selected internal
rows are emitted. They may not select the internal rows.

### 1.3 Open at selected/no-knob tier

The true closure frontier is now one object family:

```text
selected Route-C/Strominger Galerkin residual solve
  -> source-verified D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD/C1 operator payload
  -> ordered zero-mode bases
  -> primitive C1 contractions
  -> internal Rtheta scalar rows
  -> Yukawa/CKM/PMNS/lambda_H/mass values
  -> covariance/RG comparison
```

No other older source wall should be allowed to replace this unless it emits
new selected operator values.

## 2. Why the loop kept happening

The repo contains many historically true but now superseded statements:

- "unpatched source identity open"
- "P_s/rho_s open"
- "threshold rows open"
- "post-Pi convention open"
- "alpha1/dotD open"
- "matter-slot static readout open"

Several of these were true at earlier layers. They are no longer the active
frontier after Steps 14, 16, and 17.

Future artifacts must use the following replacement vocabulary:

- Not: "source identity is open"
  - Say: "operator-level Route-C/Strominger solve is open"
- Not: "projectors/rho_s are open"
  - Say: "stationary projectors/rho_s are closed; coherent spectral
    D_E zero-mode projectors from the selected operator solve are open"
- Not: "threshold rows are open"
  - Say: "external threshold rows are admitted; internal selected numerical
    rows are open"
- Not: "alpha1 is open" without qualification
  - Say: "postsource alpha1 support is closed; same-branch operator-level
    dotD_alpha1 from the selected solve is open"

## 3. Full dependency graph

```text
S0 Selected branch/source discipline
  closed by Step 14/15/16

S1 Stationary finite projector/rho_s packet
  closed by Step 17

S2 Source-level projective gerbe rho_E
  closed by Step 17

S3 Selected visible operator source
  open: same-source nonabelian V_alpha packet OR Route-C finite solve

S4 Route-C/Strominger Galerkin solve
  open: actual selected values

S5 Operator payload
  open: D_E, Riesz, Green, dotD, C1

S6 Zero-mode basis and primitive contractions
  open: ordered L2-horizontal K_s, primitive C1/Yukawa overlaps

S7 Internal Rtheta scalar rows
  open: ten numerical rows from selected payload

S8 SM numerical closure
  open: Yukawa magnitudes, CKM/PMNS, lambda_H, masses, RG/covariance
```

## 4. Two legal routes to the same missing object

The repo now says the remaining visible/operator source can close in two ways.
Both must land on the same payload validators.

### Route A: non-split rank-2 `V_alpha` same-source packet

Primary source shape:

```text
0 -> L -> V_alpha -> L^-1 -> 0
L = (1,-2,0)
c1(V_alpha)=0
c2(V_alpha)=+4 alpha1
```

Must close:

- selected ordered L3-K2 source status
- Pic0 selection or quotient rule
- nonzero `H^1(X,L^2)` Ext class
- non-split extension
- stability/HYM witness
- Chern-Weil derivation of the visible `Tr F^2` alpha1 row
- same-source D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green data
- coherent spectral projector retention
- primitive C1 contractions

Reusable inputs:

- q79 `visible_rank2_l2_*` certificates
- q79 `visible_valpha_*` candidates
- constants repo terminal monad lane selector and visible L2 orientation work
- SM closure `selected_visible_chern_weil_operator_source.candidate.json`

Current status:

- best source candidate identified
- split/diagonal abelian shortcut retired
- H1/Ext validator formulated but selected data still absent
- Pic0/source selector still open

### Route B: direct Route-C/Strominger finite solve

Primary execution contract:

`selected_routec_strominger_galerkin_solve_spec.candidate.json`

Must compute:

- selected source verification for q79/F,m=1 S3/GS branch
- basis `B_N` beyond left-invariant smoke
- deck/periodic constraints
- bundle transition/equivariant matrices
- metric volume quadrature
- selected metric/connection `(A*, h*)`
- projective/twisted `rho_E` induced by the selected source
- sector `D_E` for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H
- Riesz projectors, complement gaps, reduced Green operators
- truncation/error bounds
- same-branch `dotD_alpha1`
- zero-mode bases and primitive C1 contractions

Reusable inputs:

- q79 route-C finite solve scaffold
- q79 non-invariant Galerkin basis skeleton
- SM closure selected S3 gerbe/rhoE source-level promotion
- SM closure stationary projector/rho_s packet
- constants repo Route-C and visible operator Hessian frontier imports
- protospinor long-chain residual/projector source-rule contracts

Current status:

- executable spec exists
- validator order is locked
- output manifest is known
- actual selected values are not yet computed

## 5. Chosen strategy

Run both routes, but prioritize Route B first.

Reason:

- Route B has the clearest computational contract.
- Route B can produce the exact payload needed by Rtheta scalar execution.
- Route A remains the mathematical source-theorem route and may certify the
  same solve after the fact.
- If Route B produces a selected residual solve, Route A's stability/source
  obligations become more constrained and easier to prove.

Do not abandon Route A. Use it as a source-certification pressure test for
Route B.

## 6. Phase plan

### Phase 1: make the Route-C solve executable in-repo

Output artifact:

`MTT_Selected_Step18_RouteCStromingerGalerkinSolve_or_InternalRThetaRows_v1`

Tasks:

1. Create a single Step 18 execution workdir under `candidate_data`.
2. Import the output manifest from `selected_routec_strominger_galerkin_solve_spec`.
3. Copy or link q79 validators:
   - `validate_iwasawa_route_c_residuals.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_rhoE_mesh.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_rhoE_metric.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_sector_maps.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_de_action.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_riesz_gap.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_reduced_green.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_dotd_response.py`
   - `validate_iwasawa_selected_source_promotion.py`
4. Emit one local runner that produces all expected packets, even if initial
   values are scaffold/failing.
5. Add audit checks that distinguish:
   - selected source values
   - smoke/identity values
   - diagnostic support
   - admitted external replay

Success:

- one command runs the full Step 18 pipeline
- failures name missing numerical/symbolic entries, not missing architecture

### Phase 2: fill the finite basis/quadrature layer

Output:

- `spectral_galerkin_data.candidate.json`
- `basis_B_N.candidate.json`
- `quadrature_metric_volume.candidate.json`

Tasks:

     exists
   - otherwise finite-element/fundamental-domain cell basis
2. Encode deck/periodic gluing constraints.
3. Encode bundle transition/equivariant matrices.
4. Emit Gram and stiffness matrices.
5. Prove the basis extends beyond left-invariant scalar-count=1 smoke.

Acceptance:

   - Strominger residual
   - Bianchi/Green-Schwarz alpha1 row
   - projective rhoE cocycle
   - metric compatibility
3. Prove source-selected branch selection or explicitly report residuals.

- residuals below tolerance or symbolic proof marks pass
- positive gates set:
  - `riesz_gap_min`
  - `mtt_hessian_min_eigenvalue`
- selected source promotion validator passes for `rhoE_source`

### Phase 4: emit sector operators

Output:

- `sector_maps.candidate.json`
- `de_action.candidate.json`

Tasks:

1. Build sector maps Q,u,d,L,e,N,H.
2. Emit `D_E,s` matrices/actions from the same selected source.
3. Verify End0 equivariance and sector-block compatibility.
4. Preserve stationary `P_s/K_s/rho_s` from Step 17 as closed support.

Acceptance:

- sector maps validator passes
- D_E action validator passes
- selected flags true by theorem/solve, not lifted from smoke packets

### Phase 5: spectral projector, gap, and Green layer

Output:

- `riesz_gap.candidate.json`
- `reduced_green.candidate.json`

Tasks:

1. Compute eigenclusters for each sector operator.
2. Emit Riesz projectors for rank pattern:
   - Q,u,d,L,e,N: rank 3
   - H: rank 1
3. Emit complement gaps and error bounds.
4. Emit reduced Green operators.

Acceptance:

```text
epsilon_low + eta_total < tau < gamma_gap - eta_total
rank(P_s)=3 for Q,u,d,L,e,N
rank(P_H)=1
P_s self-adjoint/idempotent
Green residual passes
coherent spectral projector retention = true
```

### Phase 6: same-branch dotD_alpha1

Output:

- `dotd_response.candidate.json`

Tasks:

1. Compute `deltaTheta_C1` from the selected Hessian/C1 equation.
2. Compute `dotD_alpha1 = dD_E(deltaTheta_C1)/depsilon`.
3. Check horizontal zero-mode response:
   `dotPsi_a,i = -G_a Q_a dotD_a Psi_a,i`.
4. Connect this to the already closed postsource alpha1 support without
   treating support as value emission.

Acceptance:

- `alpha1_driver_verified = true`
- `selected_dotD_source_verified = true`
- `same_branch_derivative_verified = true`

Tasks:

1. Use selected zero-mode bases and Green/dotD data.
2. Compute primitive 3x3 contraction terms.
3. Assemble response matrices for the ten Rtheta scalar rows.
4. Re-run qualitative tests:
   - three-family splitting
   - nonzero CP invariant
   - mixing commutator nonzero

Acceptance:

- primitive C1/Yukawa overlap contractions emitted from selected source
- conditional/support Weyl-pair packets no longer needed as source
- no target fitting

### Phase 8: internal Rtheta scalar execution

Output:

- `internal_rtheta_scalar_rows.candidate.json`

Tasks:

1. Feed selected operator payload into Rtheta higher-response functional.
2. Emit ten scalar rows.
3. Compare to admitted external rows only after emission.
4. Decide:
   - no knobs
   - one universal parameter
   - small finite parameter set

Acceptance:

- `accepted_internal_scalar_row_count > 0`
- coefficient/value functional source provenance closed
- if a parameter is selected, it must be selected by MTT source policy, not fit

### Phase 9: true SM numerical closure

Output:

- `true_sm_equivalence_final.candidate.json`

Tasks:

1. Compute:
   - Yukawa magnitudes
   - CKM angles/phase
   - PMNS values if included
   - running mass ratios
   - lambda_H
   - gauge/Higgs threshold rows
2. Transport to common scheme/scale.
3. Run covariance/profile likelihood.
4. Produce final comparison table.

Acceptance tiers:

- Tier A: no-knob exact/within uncertainty
- Tier B: one to three selected universal source parameters
- Tier C: parity-only with measured parameters, not true no-knob closure

## 7. Parallel Route A workstream

Run alongside Route B, but do not let it block Route B.

### A1. Fill visible rank-2 L2 cohomology data

Inputs:

- q79 `visible_rank2_l2_cohomology_data.template.json`
- q79 `visible_rank2_l2_ordered_source.template.json`
- constants repo terminal monad lane source selector attempts

Output:

- selected `H^1(X,L^2)` cochain packet
- closed non-exact Ext vector
- Pic0 quotient or selection rule

### A2. Prove non-split stability/HYM witness

Output:

- selected non-split extension stability certificate
- same-source HYM/Strominger witness or equivalence to Route-C residual solve

### A3. Same-source Chern-Weil row

Output:

- Chern-Weil derivation of visible `Tr F^2` alpha1 row from selected
  non-split source

### A4. Fuse with S3/projective gerbe source

Output:

- same-source monad/GS/operator fusion packet
- no patchwork between independent sources

## 8. Cross-repo imports to keep active

### q79 repo

Use:

- exact central/charge branch closure
- S3 gerbe/projective rhoE certificates
- visible rank-2 L2 and V_alpha route
- Route-C finite solve scaffold
- non-invariant Galerkin basis skeleton
- selected source promotion validator

Do not overuse:

- q79 measured/diagnostic replay as SM value source
- route-C smoke payloads with selected flags false

### nonsm constants repo

Use:

- determinant/threshold/operator scaffold
- electroweak kernel interface
- visible operator/hessian frontier import
- terminal monad lane selector attempts
- common `D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green` payload map

Do not overuse:

- constants as selectors for SM rows
- scalar determinant proxies as Yukawa/Higgs values

### protospinor/GR repo

Use:

- long residual/projector source-rule contracts
- differentiated residual-projector source discipline
- honest Galerkin C1 execution lanes

Do not overuse:

- GR/protospinor parity bridge as no-knob SM proof
- transport-only no-go packets as final blockers after Route-C solve

## 9. Anti-loop tests for every future artifact

Every new proof/calculation must answer:

1. Does this emit a new selected value, or only relabel support?
2. Which validator can reject it?
3. Which previous blocker does it retire?
4. Which previous blocker is forbidden to reappear?
5. Is any observed SM value used before internal rows are emitted?
6. Is this source-selected, admitted external replay, or diagnostic?

Minimum audit fields:

```json
{
  "observed_data_used_as_selector": false,
  "target_fitting_used": false,
  "selected_source_verified": true_or_false,
  "admitted_external_replay_only": true_or_false,
  "support_only": true_or_false,
  "retired_blockers": {},
  "must_not_reopen": {},
  "next_actual_computation": ""
}
```

## 10. Immediate next action

Create Step 18 as an executable runner, not another theorem-only packet.

Concrete first deliverable:

```text
scripts/run_selected_step18_routec_strominger_galerkin_solve.py
candidate_data/selected_step18_routec_strominger_galerkin_solve_or_internalrtheta/
  route_c_residual.candidate.json
  spectral_galerkin_data.candidate.json
  rhoE_mesh.candidate.json
  rhoE_metric.candidate.json
  sector_maps.candidate.json
  de_action.candidate.json
  riesz_gap.candidate.json
  reduced_green.candidate.json
  dotd_response.candidate.json
  c1_primitive_contractions.candidate.json
```

The first run may fail. That is acceptable if it produces exact missing fields.
The failure must be computational, not architectural.

## 11. Definition of success

The wall is broken when Step 18 emits at least one internally selected scalar
row source from selected operator data.

Full true SM closure requires:

```text
selected Route-C/Strominger solve passes
selected D_E/Riesz/Green/dotD/C1 payload emitted
primitive C1 contractions emitted
internal Rtheta scalar rows emitted
Yukawa/CKM/PMNS/lambda_H/mass values computed
common RG/covariance comparison passes
no observed values used as selectors
```

Until then, the correct statement is:

MTT has closed the source/domain/projector/rho_s/source-level gerbe stack and
has reduced true SM closure to one selected finite operator-solve problem.
