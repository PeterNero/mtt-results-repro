# Route-C Source Provenance or Basis Reduction Import v1

## Result

The conditional Weyl-pair solve has reduced the algebraic problem to selected
source provenance. The provenance and basis support stacks are closed, but the
actual R1/R4 gates are not.

R1 remains blocked by missing selected `Phi_fin` values from the selected
Strominger/HYM minimizer:

```text
rho_E, metric, connection, sector projectors, D_E, Riesz/Green, dotD,
finite C1 Hessian source, horizontal responses, primitive contractions
```

R4 remains blocked by missing quotient/deck-valid `B_N` basis data:

```text
selected deck/cover, scalar basis, bundle equivariance, metric quadrature,
Gram/stiffness entries, eigenpairs, selected D_E action
```

## Status

```text
ROUTEC_PROVENANCE_BASIS_SUPPORT_CLOSED_SELECTED_PRIMITIVES_OPEN
```

The next legal artifact is:
