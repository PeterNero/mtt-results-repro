# MTT Selected DeltaV to CKM AngleMagnitudeMap or HonestFlavorObservableExecution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_DELTAV_TO_CKM_ANGLEMAP_LEADING_POLICY_MAP_EXECUTED_CORRECTION_OPEN`.

## Theorem

`DeltaVToCKMAngleMapLeadingExecutionTheorem` is proved.

The selected `Delta_v`/q79 branch and the minimal flavor policy rows admit a
natural leading map:

```text
s12 = sqrt(|Y_d1| / |Y_d2|)
s23 = sqrt(|Y_u1| / |Y_u2|)
s13 = sqrt(|Y_u1| / |Y_u3|)
delta = 2*pi*79/448
```

This executes a real leading CKM matrix from the selected source chain.  It is
not exact CKM closure.

## Leading Predictions

```text
s12 = 0.224302861523572
s23 = 0.041191987459391
s13 = 0.003548908297207
J   = 2.856816219576763e-05
```

Relative residuals against the measured replay packet:

```text
s12 residual = 0.003142697998
s23 residual = 0.015016262972
s13 residual = 0.049050339246
J residual   = 0.083080251165
```

## Boundary

Accepted exact CKM angle rows: `0`.

The next object is a selected correction functional, not another import/status
bridge. It must emit the small angle corrections from source data:

```text
C_CKM(Delta_v, T_profile, dynamic overlap/Hessian rows)
```
