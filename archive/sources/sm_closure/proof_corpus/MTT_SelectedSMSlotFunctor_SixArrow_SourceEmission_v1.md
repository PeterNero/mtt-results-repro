# MTT SelectedSMSlotFunctor SixArrow SourceEmission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_SMSLOTFUNCTOR_SIXARROW_PARTIAL_SOURCE_EMISSION_BUILT_POLARIZATION_NORMALIZATION_OPEN`.

## Result

The axiom-backed terminal section-ring source now emits the first three
SM-slot functor arrows:

1. terminal Ext source -> `10_M` clock row: `u,e`;
2. terminal Ext source -> `bar5_M` shift row: `d`;
3. terminal Ext source -> `1_M=N^c` Dirac row: `nuD`.

This uses the patched terminal source, selected `L=(1,-2,0)`, selected
`L^2=(2,-4,0)`, selected `h1=8` Ext packet, and the structural SU(5)/E6 slot
dictionary.  It does not use measured constants, locked C1 columns, or benchmark
matrices.

## Still Open

The remaining arrows are:

4. selected `U_10=I_3`, `U_bar5=F` as source outputs;
5. selected overlap/transfer normalization;
6. full same-source consistency map.

The q79 finite packet and transported projectors are strong support, but they
still need a selected polarization/overlap operator packet before all six arrows
are closed.

Next artifact: `MTT_SelectedSMSlotFunctor_PolarizationAndOverlap_SourceEmission_v1`.
