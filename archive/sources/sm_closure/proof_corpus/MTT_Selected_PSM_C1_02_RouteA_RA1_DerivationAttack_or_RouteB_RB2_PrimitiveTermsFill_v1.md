Closed boundary label: `DONE-PARITY-00`

## Theorem

**PSMC102RA1DerivationAttackOrRB2PrimitiveTermsFillTheorem.** For PSM-C1-02, external variational/Galerkin literature supports the methodological split between ROUTE-A physical-action derivation and ROUTE-B weighted-residual execution, but supplies no MTT source proof. ROUTE-A/RA-1 is refined to the physical equality S_C1' = C1DefectLeakageFunctional on selected admissible variations. ROUTE-B/RB-2 is filled with all 72 primitive contraction support rows from the existing qutrit Weyl residual terms, while remaining open as selected Galerkin proof because the rows are not independent quadrature/source emissions.

## Superset Strategy

`ROUTE-A` uses the variational/physical-action path. `ROUTE-B` uses the weighted-residual/Galerkin execution path. External references are methodological only and do not count as selected MTT source proof.

## Route Status

- `PSM-C1-02 / ROUTE-A / RA-1`: refined, still open.
- `PSM-C1-02 / ROUTE-B / RB-2`: 72 primitive support rows filled, selected-source promotion still open.
