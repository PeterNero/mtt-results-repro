# q79 Zero-Defect Vacuum Selection No-Go and State/Boundary Cutset v1

Status:
`EINSTEIN_TEGR_VACUUM_DOES_NOT_SELECT_FLAT_ENDPOINT_CLOSED_NOGO_STATE_BOUNDARY_OR_POSITIVE_DEFECT_SELECTION_REQUIRED`

## Question

The previous theorem proves that the displayed `Q_WW=I` endpoint is exactly
Minkowski and that a zero-stress Minkowski vacuum requires `Lambda_eff=0`.
Could the already selected leading Einstein/TEGR equations then force that
flat endpoint?

No.

## Exact curved vacuum witness

In coordinates `(u,v,x,y)`, take

```text
H=x^2-y^2,
ds^2=H du^2-2 du dv+dx^2+dy^2.
```

The metric determinant is exactly `-1`, so it is nondegenerate and Lorentzian.
The transverse profile is harmonic:

```text
partial_x^2 H+partial_y^2 H=2-2=0.
```

Direct symbolic calculation of the Levi-Civita connection gives

```text
Ricci=0,
R=0,
Einstein=0,
```

while the Riemann tensor is not zero. Representative plus-polarized components
are

```text
R_uxux=-1,
R_uyuy=+1.
```

This is therefore an exact curved, zero-stress, `Lambda_eff=0` solution of the
same Einstein bulk equation class selected at leading order.

## Teleparallel reading

A null coframe is

```text
ell=du,
n=dv-(H/2)du,
g=-2 ell n+dx^2+dy^2.
```

In Weitzenbock gauge,

```text
d n=-(1/2)dH wedge du
   =-x dx wedge du+y dy wedge du,
```

which is nonzero. The exact TEGR/Einstein boundary identity therefore does not
mean that vacuum TEGR sets torsion or closure anholonomy to zero. It means the
bulk field equations are equivalent.

## Consequence

Neither of these implications is valid:

```text
zero stress + Lambda_eff=0 => flat spacetime,
double return + zero stress + Lambda_eff=0 => flat spacetime.
```

The action form is no longer the missing object for this question. Flat-vacuum
selection requires an additional state principle or boundary theorem. A strict
five-row contract is now exposed:

```text
select the global solution domain and boundary class,
exclude nonflat Ricci-flat helicity-two waves when perfect closure is intended,
select zero-defect initial or asymptotic data,
derive Lambda_eff=0,
prove the Q_WW zero source is the selected ground state.
```

No row is supplied by the current corpus. A different valid route would derive
a positive defect functional whose unique physical minimizer is the zero source.
That functional must come from MTT; defining it ad hoc would not be a selection
theorem.

No observed value and no fitted parameter is used.
