The theorem is derived: dotD closure is equivalent to a same-source
source-strength value proving `du/dalpha1=h_ext` in the selected
zero-mean HYM row gauge. The current corpus does not emit that value,
so the driver flag cannot honestly be flipped yet.

## Theorem

On the selected transported End0/HYM/B_N branch, honest dotD_alpha1 closure is equivalent to emitting one same-source source-strength value: du/dalpha1=h_ext in the selected zero-mean HYM row gauge, with the normalization fixed by the selected Phi_fin/Strominger/Chern-Weil operator functional. If and only if that value is emitted, the already closed transport derivative supplies selected_dotD_source_verified, alpha1_driver_verified becomes theorem-derived, and the existing finite dotD matrices pass honest replay. The current corpus does not emit that value; therefore the theorem is derived, but the branch is not closed.

## Current-Source No-Go

The present repository and sibling packets do not contain a selected source-strength value. All artifacts that could supply it either keep the value open, reduce to Phi_fin/Chern-Weil operator data, or forbid using diagnostic lifted flags and observed constants. Therefore setting alpha1_driver_verified=true now would violate the acceptance contract.
