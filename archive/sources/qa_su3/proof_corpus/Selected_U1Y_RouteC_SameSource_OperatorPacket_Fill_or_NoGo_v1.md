# Selected U1Y Route-C Same-Source Operator Packet Fill or No-Go v1

## Result

```text
status = U1Y_ROUTEC_SAMESOURCE_OPERATORPACKET_FILL_NOGO_CURRENT_SCAFFOLDS_SUPPORT_ONLY
required_fields = 7
support_present = 6
selected_emitted = 0
current_scaffold_nogo_proved = true

```

The fill attempt is now executed in the U1/Y repo by importing the strict
SM same-source validator and binding it to the current U1/Y hybrid packet
and the q79 V_alpha/S3 operator-source attempt. The result is a scoped
current-scaffold no-go: support exists, but none of the seven required
same-source selected fields is emitted.

## Seven Required Fields

| Field | Provenance | Support | Selected | Same Source | Theorem Derived |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source_identity` | `support_shape_only` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `matter_slot_charge` | `support_shape_only` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `singlet_neutrino_rule` | `support_shape_only` | `false` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `operator_values` | `support_shape_only` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `overlap_transfer` | `locked_target_selection` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `normalization` | `locked_target_selection` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `primitive_contractions` | `support_shape_only` | `true` | `false` | `false` | `false` |

## Why The Fill Fails

- the imported SM same-source validator rejects all seven required fields
- the U1/Y hybrid packet has zero selected emissions across the same seven fields
- the q79 V_alpha/S3 same-source attempt remains open with operator-source blockers
- locked-target overlap and normalization entries are retained only as conditional diagnostics

This is not a mathematical impossibility theorem. It says the currently
printed source records cannot be promoted to the selected U1/Y Route-C
operator packet under the strict same-source validator.

## Minimal Source-Emission Attack Plan

Next artifact: `Selected_U1Y_RouteC_SourceEmission_MinimalSubpacket_AttackPlan_v1`.

### source_identity_bridge
- selected visible/Route-C/V_alpha source identity
- same-source binding from selected S3/Green-Schwarz support to terminal V_alpha or Route-C source
- Pic0 selection or quotient policy

### operator_values_payload
- selected Route-C residual
- selected D_E
- selected Riesz/Green
- selected dotD
- same-source alpha1/operator driver

### matter_overlap_payload
- selected matter-slot charge table
- selected 1_M Dirac-neutrino routing rule
- selected overlap-transfer functor
- selected trace/Hessian normalization
- selected primitive C1/Yukawa contractions

## Guardrails

- No observed masses, CKM, PMNS, CP phase, or benchmark matrix entries are used.
- Locked-target overlap and normalization data remain diagnostic only.
- Finite fixture data and lifted source flags are not promoted.
- `A_selected`, `b_selected`, `lambda_12`, and full closure remain open.
