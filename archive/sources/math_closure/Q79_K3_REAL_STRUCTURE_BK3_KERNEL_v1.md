# q79 K3 real structure and rank-zero b_K3 kernel

## Result

The selected q79 degree-two K3 has

`rho=2`, `NS(X_Qbar)=diag(2,-4)`, and `rank T(X)=20`.

The remaining global `b_K3` ambiguity was whether its large-gauge kernel had
rank zero or one. This packet proves

`rank Lambda_b=0`.

Thus the map from the two real `b_K3` parameters is injective, while its image
is dense and nonclosed in the compact transcendental `T20` already selected
by the Picard theorem.

## Exact real-sextic topology

Project the real branch sextic by `[x:y:z] -> [x:z]`. The projection center
is not on the curve. The exact critical-value resultant has degree
`30`, is squarefree, and has
exactly `6`
real roots. Exact Sturm counts on the seven complementary intervals give

`[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]`.

The fiber at infinity is squarefree and has exactly two real points. The two
bounded active bands form two ovals; the two tails and the two regular
infinity points form one further oval. Hence the real branch curve has
exactly three components.

For every possible nesting of three ovals and either outside sign,

`chi(R_plus) in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`,

so

`chi(X(R)) in [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6]`.

## Conjugation obstruction

The real Lefschetz formula gives the possible dimensions

`dim H2_+ in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`.

The real divisor classes `H` and `delta` lie in the minus eigenspace of the
antiholomorphic pullback, leaving the possible transcendental signatures

`[[8, 12], [9, 11], [10, 10], [11, 9], [12, 8], [13, 7]]`.

If a rank-one `b_K3` kernel existed, its rational generator would be a
conjugation eigenvector. Reflection in that vector, composed with
conjugation, is a rational Hodge endomorphism of the simple transcendental
K3 Hodge structure. It would force the signature to be `(1,19)` or `(19,1)`.
Neither occurs. Rank one is impossible, and rank two was already excluded by
`rho=2`; therefore the kernel has rank zero.

## Consequence and boundary

Numerical periods are no longer required to decide the global kernel
topology. They remain necessary for preferred normalization, kinetic scales,
and explicit period values. This theorem does not construct the physical
non-pullback Hull-Strominger endpoint or the selected shared-circle upper
action, and it has no bearing on the separate eta9 object named `F0`.
