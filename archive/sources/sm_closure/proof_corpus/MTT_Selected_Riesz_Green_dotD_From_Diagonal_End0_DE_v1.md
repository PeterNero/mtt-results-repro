# MTT Selected Riesz Green dotD From Diagonal End0 DE v1

## Result

The protected diagonal `T3` End0 spectral lane is closed:

```text
D_E = d + ad(du*T3)
ad(T3) T3 = 0
P0[f] = mean(f) * T3
G = (-Delta)^(-1) on zero-mean scalar fields, tensor T3
```

The deterministic Fourier replay gives:

```text
||(-Delta)GQf - Qf||_L2 = 8.613e-16
lambda_1(-Delta) = 39.4784176044
||G|| <= 0.0253302959106
```

The formal Frechet derivative is also fixed:

```text
dotD_a[h] = (partial_a h) ad(T3)
```

## Guardrail

This is not full validator-ready `Riesz/Green/dotD` data. It closes the
protected diagonal `T3` spectral lane and the formal variation schema only.
The coupled `T1/T2` covariant Green operator, physical same-branch
`dotD_alpha1`, rank2-to-sector transfer, and off-diagonal control theorem
remain open.
