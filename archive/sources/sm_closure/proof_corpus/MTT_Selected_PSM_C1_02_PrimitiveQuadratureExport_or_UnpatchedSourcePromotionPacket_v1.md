# MTT Selected PSM C1 02 PrimitiveQuadratureExport or UnpatchedSourcePromotionPacket v1

Status label: `PSM-C1-02 / SOURCE-IDENTITY / SI-1u-B2`

Parallel label: `PSM-C1-02 / SOURCE-IDENTITY / SI-1u-A`

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PSM_C1_02_SI1U_B2_LOCAL_PRINCIPLE_SOURCE_PACKET_VALIDATES_UNPATCHED_THEOREM_OPEN`

Closed boundary label: `DONE-PARITY-00`

## Result

`SI-1u-B2` now has a validating PSM-C1-02 source-promotion packet under the
local `SelectedFiniteC1SourceIdentityPrinciple`.

The packet validates the exact blockers:

- selected measure pairing
- selected quadrature rule
- phase `R_Z` primitive sources
- shift `R_X` primitive sources
- `b_selected` Hessian source
- sector row assembly
- emitted-before-residual-replay

This is not the unpatched theorem.  It is the local-principle/patched source
identity closure carried forward into the PSM-C1-02 label system.

## Superset Use

This combines the finite-C1 trace path, the stationary transported projector
path, and the PSM validator path against one constrained target.  These are not
knobs: no observed constants, target residuals, or adjustable coefficients are
used as selectors.

## True Frontier

The remaining frontier is now sharper:

`SI-1u-A`: derive the `SelectedFiniteC1SourceIdentityPrinciple` from the
selected action, or replace it with honest finite-action/Galerkin execution.
