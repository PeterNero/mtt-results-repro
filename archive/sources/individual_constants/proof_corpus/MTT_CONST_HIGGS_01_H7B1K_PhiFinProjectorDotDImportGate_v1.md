## Result

```text
stationary Phi_fin/projector/rho_s/dotD slot imported  True
physical dotD/alpha1 active blocker removed            True
H-sector imported carrier                              rank-one H:h0
strict dynamic Huv/M_source gate passes                False
H_response / R_H / B_Huv / M_source emitted            False
Huv / Omega / s_beta / lambda_H                        False
```

## What Closed

The later stationary source artifacts close a real subgate that H7B1J had left
open.  The repaired route is:

```text
raw BN equality rejected
gauge-transported Phi_fin trace proved
finite projector source promotion proved
validator-ready stationary rho_s promoted
selected dotD and alpha1 driver imported
Riesz/Green/dotD/projector-retention slot closed
```

This is a legitimate superset reconciliation: the HYM/End0 stationary projector
path and the alpha1/dotD path are combined against the locked stationary
source-packet target, without using observed Higgs data or threshold fitting.

## What Did Not Close

The imported Higgs sector is still the rank-one stationary `H:h0` carrier with
identity transport.  That is not the UV two-Higgs `H_u/H_d^dagger` lift and it
is not a dynamic Huv mass-strain response.  Therefore it cannot emit
`H_response`, `R_H`, `B_Huv`, `M_source`, `Omega`, `s_beta`, or `lambda_H`.
