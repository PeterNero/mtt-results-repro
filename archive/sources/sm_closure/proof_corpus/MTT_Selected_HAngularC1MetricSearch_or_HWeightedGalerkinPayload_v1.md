# MTT Selected HAngular C1 Metric Search or HWeighted Galerkin Payload v1

## Theorem

`HAngularC1MetricSearchAndPayloadContractTheorem` is emitted.

## Result

Selected `s_beta=0.004701083905943647` was imported as clean H angular data and combined
with finite C1 scalar data to test H-angular/C1 metric candidates for:

```text
tau_H = 4.018017196377461
```

Accepted H-angular/C1 source rows: `0`.

Best diagnostic near miss:

```text
4*sqrt(1 + (2)*s_beta) = 4.018760341820621
relative residual = 0.00018495327591670752
```

This is not promoted because no same-source H-weighted Galerkin integral,
metric finite part, or direct radial operator emits the expression.

## Boundary

`s_beta` fixes the H angular ray. C1 fixes finite response shape. Neither
supplies the radial magnitude by itself.

## Next Payload

`MTT_Selected_HWeightedGalerkinMetricTauHExport_or_DirectRadialOperator_v1` must emit selected zero-mode bases, H-weighted metric/kernel rows,
primitive `3x3` H contractions, response matrices, a same-source `tau_H` export
rule, and exactness/error certificates.
