# MTT CONST EM 01 Alpha1 QA Replay v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EM_01_ALPHA1_QA_REPLAY_ACCEPTED_SOURCE_SIDE_DRIVER_CLOSED_CONVENTION_MAP_OPEN`

Label: `CONST-EM-01 / ALPHA1-SOURCE-STRENGTH / A1-REPLAY-QA`

## Result

The QA-SU3 U1Y Route-C alpha1 driver theorem has been replayed as a local
dependency rather than imported by authority.

The replay accepts the **source-side** alpha1 driver:

- `N_alpha1(h_ext)=1`,
- `lambda_alpha1=1`,
- `du/dalpha1=h_ext`,
- source-side `alpha1_driver_verified`,
- source-side honest dotD replay.

This is a real promotion for the individual-constant search, but it is not yet
the physical fine-structure constant.

## Boundary

This artifact does not claim:

- `alpha(0)`,
- `alpha(M_Z)`,
- GUT-normalized `alpha_1`,
- threshold/running closure,
- primitive `C1` contractions,
- `lambda_12`,
- Yukawa magnitudes,
- full SM or full constants closure.

No observed value, benchmark value, or target fit is used as a selector.

## Superset Strategy

This is a constrained superset import.  We combine the QA-SU3 operator/emission
route, the Chern-Weil support value, and the dotD transport route, then lock the
target to a single allowed statement: the selected MTT source-side alpha1 driver
is closed.  We do not let that combined route leak into the physical alpha
convention layer.

## Next

Next label: `CONST-EM-01 / ALPHA1-CONVENTION / A2-MAP`

Build the source-to-observable convention map before any comparison with
measured electromagnetic couplings.
