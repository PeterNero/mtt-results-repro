# MTT Selected Route-C WeylPair Aselected Assembly or Source Proof

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEC_WEYLPAIR_ASELECTED_ASSEMBLY_BUILT_CONDITIONAL_SOLVE_EXACT_SOURCE_PROOF_OPEN`

This artifact assembles the conditional Weyl-pair operator:

```text
A_weylpair_conditional = [phase_packet, shift_packet]
```

with:

- `phase_packet`: `u,e = I + Z`, `d,nuD = 0`,
- `shift_packet`: `d,nuD = I + X`, `u,e = 0`.

## Result

The conditional operator has shape `72 x 2`, rank `2`, and solves the locked
splitter equation with `deltaTheta = (1,1)` up to numerical roundoff.

This closes the algebraic assembly obstruction for the enriched Weyl-pair
packet.  It does not promote `A_weylpair_conditional` to `A_selected`.

## Remaining Blocker

The remaining blocker is now sharply provenance-theoretic:

`SelectedWeylPairSourceProvenanceLemma`

The selected q79/F,m=1 S3/Green-Schwarz Route-C source must emit the two
Weyl-pair columns as theorem-derived selected source data, in the same
B_N/projector/dotD/zero-mode basis and with internal normalization.

No observed masses, CKM, PMNS, CP phase, lifted flags, or benchmark matrices
are used.
