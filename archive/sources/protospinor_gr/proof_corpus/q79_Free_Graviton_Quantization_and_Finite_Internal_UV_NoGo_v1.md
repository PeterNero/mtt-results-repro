## Free quantum sector

The connected q79 internal geometry supplies one normalized scalar zero mode.
Tensoring it with the global helicity-two bundle gives exactly two physical
real polarizations per nonzero spatial momentum. The finite root-stack
Reynolds theorem gives the same positive coefficient to both.

With

```text
q_lambda=sqrt(kappa_h) h_lambda,
```

the reduced free Hamiltonian is

```text
H_free=(1/2) sum_lambda integral d^3x
       [pi_lambda^2+|grad q_lambda|^2].
```

For each momentum this is two identical positive harmonic oscillators. The
standard Fock relations give

```text
[a_lambda(k),a_lambda'(k')^dagger]
  =(2pi)^3 delta_lambda,lambda' delta^3(k-k'),
```

and the TT propagator is

```text
<h_lambda h_lambda'>
  =i delta_lambda,lambda'/[kappa_h(p^2+i0)].
```

The normalized massless residue is exactly `I2`. No continuous parameter is
added beyond the already necessary classical `kappa_h`. A time orientation
and causal vacuum/`i0` prescription remain state data.

## Finite internal algebra is not a 4D UV regulator

The q79 source has finite internal dimension, so internal traces and mode sums
are exact and finite. But for any large-momentum integrand,

```text
Tr_internal[p^n I_N]=N p^n.
```

The finite factor `N` does not change the power of the unbounded
four-dimensional loop momentum. It therefore cannot by itself remove the
standard interacting Einstein-gravity UV problem. Pure Einstein gravity is a
consistent low-energy quantum EFT, but its two-loop divergence requires a
higher-curvature counterterm; see
<https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9405057> and the original two-loop result at
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0370269385914704>.

The existing MTT Stieltjes theorem also excludes the tempting shortcut of
combining a positive massless spectral representation with permanent Gaussian
propagator damping. The A51-A53 spectral route remains possible only after its
measure, Lorentzian reconstruction, and full remainder are selected and
controlled.

## Exact boundary

Closed:

```text
the free two-helicity q79 graviton Hilbert/Fock sector,
positive reduced Hamiltonian for kappa_h>0,
the massless propagator shape and unit internal residue,
the no-go for finite internal dimension alone curing 4D loop UV behavior.
```

Open:

```text
the selected interacting quantum measure,
constraint/BRST closure beyond the free tier,
higher-curvature coefficients or a nonperturbative completion,
unitarity and UV control of the completed interacting theory.
```
