# MTT Selected HYM Adjoint Transfer Functor v1

## Claim

The rank mismatch is reduced.  The selected rank-2 source does not have to be
forced directly into an unrelated rank-3 scaffold.  Because
`det(V_alpha)=L tensor L^-1` is trivial, the canonical carrier

```text
Ad(V_alpha) = End_0(V_alpha)
```

is rank 3.  A selected HYM connection `A` on `V_alpha` induces the connection
`ad(A)` on `End_0(V_alpha)`, with curvature `F_ad(A)=ad(F_A)`.  Thus HYM
residual zero transfers functorially at the abstract bundle level.

This adds no continuous parameter.

## What Closes

The abstract rank-2-to-rank-3 transfer functor is available if the operator
carrier is declared as `End_0(V_alpha)`.  The previous type mismatch is now a
finite basis/isomorphism problem, not a conceptual source contradiction.

## What Remains Open

No finite operator values are emitted here.  We still need:

- the selected HYM coefficient vector or analytic representative;
- a selected finite basis for `End_0(V_alpha)`;
- proof that the existing 27-mode qutrit/family `B_N` scaffold is that selected
  finite trace, or replacement by the actual `End_0(V_alpha)` basis;
- `rho_E`, metric, `D_E`, Riesz/Green, `dotD`, and C1 replay without lifted
  flags.
