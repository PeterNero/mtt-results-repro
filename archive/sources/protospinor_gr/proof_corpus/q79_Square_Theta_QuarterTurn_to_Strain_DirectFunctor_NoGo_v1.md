# q79 Square-Theta Quarter-Turn to Strain Direct-Functor No-Go v1

Status:
`Q79_SQUARE_THETA_DIRECT_ADJOINT_TO_STRAIN_QUARTERTURN_CLOSED_NOGO_NONTRIVIAL_INVERSE_FOURIER_MUKAI_FUNCTOR_OR_DIRECT_HYM_REQUIRED`

## Exact geometric action

The constructive square elliptic packet uses

```text
E: b^2*c=a^3-a*c^2,
H^0(E,O(3*0))=<a,b,c>.
```

The origin-preserving elliptic quarter-turn is

```text
(a,b,c)->(-a,i*b,c),
U_theta=diag(-1,i,1).
```

Direct substitution sends the cubic polynomial to its negative, so the same
projective cubic is preserved, and `U_theta^4=I` exactly.

## Induced action on Herm(3)

Use the trace-orthonormal basis

```text
D1,D2,D3,
S23,S13,S12,
K23,K13,K12.
```

The exact real adjoint action `X->U_theta X U_theta^*` has

```text
dim ker(Ad(U)-I)   =3,
dim ker(Ad(U)+I)   =2,
dim ker(Ad(U)^2+I)=4.
```

It fixes the three diagonal modes. One off-diagonal Hermitian plane is rotated
by `pi`, while the other two `(S_ij,K_ij)` planes are rotated by quarter turns.
Consequently

```text
Ad(U_theta)(D direct-sum S) is not contained in D direct-sum S.
```

## Basis-independent no-go

The desired lane quarter-turn `J_DE` obeys `J_DE^2=-I` on a real
six-dimensional carrier. The direct theta adjoint has only a four-dimensional
`J^2=-I` sector. Kernel dimension is invariant under change of basis, so no
conjugation can turn this direct adjoint into `J_DE` on six dimensions.

Therefore the exact abstract equality of the two `2x2` quarter-turn matrices
does not supply the same-carrier functor. In particular, the geometric
elliptic automorphism cannot simply be attached to the spectral strain symbol
by its direct degree-three theta action.

## What remains viable

This is a targeted no-go, not a no-go for Fourier-Mukai geometry. Two routes
remain:

```text
1. construct a genuinely nontrivial inverse-Fourier-Mukai functor and prove
   that its induced action on the sheet-symbol multiplicity plane is J_DE;
2. construct the actual balanced-HYM operator and compute H_std directly.
```

The packet's `tau=i` and identity alignment remain constructive trial data,
not primitive MTT selections. No observed datum or fitted parameter is used.
