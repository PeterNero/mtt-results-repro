# MTT Selected CovarianceSidecarFill or RThetaSourceRowDerivation v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_COVARIANCESIDECARFILL_OR_RTHETASOURCEROWDERIVATION_BUILT_WZH_SIDECARS_INTERIM_LADDER_RTHETA_OPEN`.

This artifact fills conservative interim W/Z/H covariance sidecars.

```text
W/Z/H interim sidecars closed       : true
interim block-diagonal profile      : true
cross-block covariance closed       : false
selected R_theta source rows closed : false
true SM equivalence closed          : false
no-knob closure                     : false
```

The sidecars use existing linear sensitivities plus conservative surrogate
systematics from the one-loop gauge bridge discrepancy or the lambda theory
sidecar. They are validation/profile sidecars, not selected MTT source rows.
