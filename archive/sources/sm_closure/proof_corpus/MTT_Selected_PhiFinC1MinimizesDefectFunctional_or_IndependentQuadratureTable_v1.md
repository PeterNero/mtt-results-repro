# MTT Selected PhiFinC1MinimizesDefectFunctional or IndependentQuadratureTable v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHIFINC1MINIMIZESDEFECTFUNCTIONAL_OR_INDEPENDENTQUADRATURETABLE_BUILT_BINDING_REDUCTION_OPEN`.

This gate reduces physical `Phi_fin^C1` minimization to a named theorem slot.

Closed now:

```text
I10 theorem slot created                    = True
depends on selected minimizer trace I1      = True
depends on selected dotD/C1 response I5     = True
quadrature table template created           = True
```

Still open:

```text
I10 proved                                  = False
independent quadrature values filled        = False
unpatched dynamic closure                   = False
```

Replay if either route is completed:

```text
A^T A      = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b      = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0]
```
