# MTT q79 Height-Four Frontier Checkpoint A409 (2026-07-22)

## Current theorem-closed state

- A400 proves the exact selected relative-chain identity
  `F=beta-sum_I Pi_I ell_I` and exact closure of the selected integral cycle.
- A401 proves the common lower B-contour homotopy; A402S supplies the exact
  `beta-H_B` source; A402 executes it in a full 13-state weighted affine frame.
  Its maximum row radius is `2.354392238079308e-4`, a `10.6580` tightening over
  the independent beta/B triangle box. Both the coordinate-conjugation audit and
  the endpoint audit pass.
- A397F/A397 close the selected d057 far-cut Frobenius tail and full residue.
  The final maximum d057 row radius is `8.102731314253762e-8`, tightening the
  canonical d057 certificate by `983.0454`.
- A406D proves the disk-specific Cauchy majorant used for d027. At radius `1/8`,
  the direct complex-disk majorant retains the strong series gate `q<1/2`; it
  avoids the larger circumscribed-square overestimate without weakening the
  Cauchy theorem.
- A406M/A406F/A406 close d027. A406M used 335 accepted steps and 39 controlled
  rejections. A406F tightens the coarse branch-reference tail by approximately
  `3.09563e11`; A406 has maximum full-row radius
  `2.6860663705028896e-6`, a `15.34135` canonical tightening. All three dedicated
  audits pass.
- A407 independently rebuilds all 76 selected chain contributions while
  preserving A397 and replacing d027 by A406. Its product-box L2 radius is
  `9.846374632410042e-4`, down from A398's `1.1079980061080295e-3`; the next
  independent width target is d082.
- A408 evaluates the exact residual partition
  `R=(beta-H_B)-C_76-H_A-3 Pi_d065`. It preserves A402's internal beta/B
  correlation and uses explicit independent Minkowski sums only for A407,
  `H_A`, and the wall. The residual L2 radius is `1.391677022862038e-3`, a
  `3.77583` tightening over A386; its maximum row radius is
  `6.596666183688278e-4`, a `4.30259` tightening. Every floating residual
  diagnostic is contained. The dedicated audit passes.
- A409T distinguishes A405's augmented residue coordinate `q` from the selected
  physical thimble residue `r_phys=-q`. It proves
  `(T_e^(q))^-1=[[U_e^-1,0],[-V_e U_e^-1,I_8]]` and, after conjugation, the
  physical reverse block
  `(T_e^(r))^-1=[[U_e^-1,0],[+V_e U_e^-1,I_8]]`. The sign bridge is bound to
  the original transport source that defines the main thimble integral as the
  negative terminal augmented state. The algebraic zero-trunk reduction is
  consequently valid in the selected physical-residue frame.
- A410 closes all 40 native-z A404 chart bridges. It certifies 80 interval
  matrices (both directions), every overlap denominator excludes zero, every
  forward determinant contains exactly `-1`, and every inverse product contains
  the identity. The dedicated reconstruction audit passes.
- A405 completed all five homogeneous basis sweeps. It emits 77 common-y
  `5x5` period operators and 77 `8x5` integrated-residue operators. The
  strengthened independent audit proves every period block interval-invertible;
  the minimum determinant absolute lower bound is `1.70587`.
- A411 extracts the terminal common-hub-to-canonical-base operator from the
  already completed A405 snapshots. Its maximum component radius is
  `1.2328818137413532e-9`, its period determinant absolute lower bound is
  `0.006077769569747609`, and its independent reconstruction audit passes.
- A413 binds the executable source contract for all 76 selected outer legs:
  36 native-y and 40 native-z cutoff sources, 380 period intervals, 608 local
  tail intervals, and 608 canonical residue rows. Every cutoff-to-entry segment
  is outward radial (maximum normalized cross error
  `1.6614118734013444e-16`, minimum radial ratio `2.1620736257716735`) and every
  A405 entry block is invertible. It records 75 retained historical checkpoints
  plus the reconstructible legacy d087 source.
- A413 also closes a convention that must not be lost: A404 stores raw A130
  coefficients, while endpoint packets use the canonical floating orientation.
  There are 34 sign reversals. For 75 targets
  `c_endpoint=s_canonical*c_A130`; d065 additionally carries the separately
  ledgered Picard-Lefschetz wall delta `+3`, changing its corrected coefficient
  from `1` to `4`. The independent all-target audit passes.
- A409O completed and its dedicated audit passes. It certifies the d057
  cutoff-to-A404 outer main leg with 353 accepted steps, 24 controlled
  rejections, and maximum residue radius `7.855750308971375e-8`.
- A412 now closes the first complete alternate junction path. It composes the
  d057 local tail, A409O outer leg, corrected physical A405 reverse block, and
  A411 terminal trunk while retaining affine frames. All eight resulting rows
  overlap the independent A397 certificate; maximum center difference is
  `1.1589508235718245e-11`, maximum radius is `0.03081069331591562`, and the
  minimum overlap margin is `0.006034629970151121`. Its dedicated replay audit
  passes.
- A414/A415 close the first native-z complete alternate path at d001. A414 used
  178 accepted steps and 23 controlled rejections with maximum outer-main
  radius `3.4817932853734704e-7`. A415 then applies the exact A410 z-to-y
  transition, corrected physical A405 reverse block, and A411 trunk. All eight
  rows overlap the independent canonical d001 certificate; maximum center
  difference is `1.4781635639898985e-14`, maximum radius is
  `4.40077216241707e-7`, and minimum overlap margin is
  `2.9603880930920897e-7`. The audit also replays the serialized entry, hub, and
  base affine generators needed for aggregate assembly.

These are endpoint interval theorems. They do not yet prove a covariant zero,
the full-polydisk Jacobian theorem, interval-Newton existence/uniqueness, or full
Standard Model closure.

## Active computation

- A405 job `07c7edde-d821-4f72-8399-d3b758030a5f` succeeded and its dedicated
  verifier passed; it is no longer an active theorem gate.
- A409O job `789d6347-9939-42fc-9847-c88b5a8bbc7b` succeeded and its dedicated
  audit passed; A412 consumes the verified output.
- The first A414 d001 job `be182aac-3c6d-4767-b31d-85264cea6b78` exposed and
  retained a pre-execution shape failure: the generic runner supplied the
  77-coordinate Hessian seed to the six-coordinate row engine. No accepted step
  or scientific artifact resulted. The runner now consumes the five certified
  full-precision period balls emitted by the same cutoff source.
- The repaired native-z d001 pilot is calculation job
  `c048f0d8-6aef-4b48-8ad2-89737293a57b`. It has accepted initial interval
  steps, succeeded, and passed both the A414 and A415 dedicated audits.
- The resumable sequential all-target runner is
  `scripts/run_q79_height4_all76_outer_junction_batch.py`. It audits every
  A414/A415 target before checkpoint promotion and treats d057 through its
  separately audited A412 packet. Its short checkpoint is `ol/b416.json`.
- A417 is staged as the all-76 thimble hub affine finalizer. It will retain one
  compact 13-coordinate block per target and apply the Picard-Lefschetz `+3`
  as the same d065 block, preserving that source correlation instead of adding
  an independent copy.
- A418 is staged and queued as job
  `5a6fd092-1869-476a-9c51-571c96e92f58`. It derives the selected A-handle
  period source at the operational hub and executes the hub-to-entry-to-`-i`
  path in one 13-state affine frame. Process success must be followed by
  `proof_corpus/selected_q79heightfourahandleouterhubaffine_audit.py`.

## Fixed remaining order

1. Execute and audit A418, then run the resumable all-target batch and finalize
   A417 once every A412/A415 authority is present.
2. Generalize the same outer-leg packet across the 36 native-y targets. For the
   40 native-z targets, instantiate the exact A123 projective period transition
   using the already audited A410 matrix at the A404 entry before applying the
   common y-chart operator; do not identify z and y coordinates numerically.
3. Attach A418 to A417 and combine all 76 integer-weighted entry states and the A-handle at the hub.
   Apply the A403 exact zero-trunk theorem only to this common-frame sum, not to
   independently transported endpoint boxes.
4. Join that full chain block to the already correlated A402 beta/B block. This
   is the first artifact allowed to set
   `full_common_relative_chain_transport_executed=true`.
5. Transport the residual Jacobian over the full A385S polydisk, then execute a
   Krawczyk/interval-Newton self-map. A point Jacobian or floating Newton seed is
   not a substitute for this step.

## Non-regression rules

- Do not reopen A397, A402, A405, A406, A407, A408, A409T, A410, or A411 unless
  an authority hash changes or a dedicated audit fails.
- A406R is a branch-sign reference only; A406F is the d027 tail bound.
- A408 preserves beta/B correlation only. It intentionally does not claim that
  chain/A-handle/wall correlation is already closed.
- Process success is not proof promotion. Each long-run artifact needs its
  dedicated verifier, current authority hashes, assumptions, and scope flags.
