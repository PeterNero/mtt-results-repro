# MTT Selected RouteBPartialIndependentProvenanceFill or BasisQuadratureGap v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEB_PARTIALINDEPENDENTPROVENANCEFILL_BUILT_BASIS_QUADRATURE_GAP_OPEN`

This step partially fills the strict Route B validator.

Closed now:

1. all 72 primitive rows are executed exactly;
2. the formal 110-row packet is executed;
3. exactness/error certificates are attached from the finite Weyl row execution;
4. finite Weyl trace/Frobenius measure uniqueness remains non-knob support.

Still open:

1. selected Galerkin/zero-mode basis independence from residual-projector replay;
2. selected quadrature rule independence from locked target values;
3. source independence of the full row packet.

The strict validator still rejects the partial fill, as it should.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RouteBSelectedBasisQuadratureSource_or_RouteAPhysicalSourceFill_v1`.
