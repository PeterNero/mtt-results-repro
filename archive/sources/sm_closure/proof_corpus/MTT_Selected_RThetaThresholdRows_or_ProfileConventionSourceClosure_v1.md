# MTT Selected RThetaThresholdRows or ProfileConventionSourceClosure v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_RTHETA_THRESHOLDROWS_OR_PROFILECONVENTIONSOURCECLOSURE_BUILT_ORDERED_FRONTIER_ROWS_OPEN`.

The five remaining `R_theta` value blockers are interlinked, but they now have
a clean partial order.

```text
ordered dependency graph closed               : true
generation structure support closed           : true
same-branch scale/scheme/loop convention      : false
threshold matching source rows                : false
mass-scheme conversion source rows            : false
no-knob value derivation                       : false
profile/diagonal acceptance theorem           : false
accepted coefficient values                    : 0
```

Order:

1. Close convention/profile semantics.
2. Emit threshold matching and mass-scheme source rows under that convention.
3. Derive no-knob values, or explicitly admit the minimal universal parameter
   escape hatch.

The profile/diagonal theorem can be attacked in parallel with convention, but
it cannot replace source rows unless it explicitly proves that replacement.

Current repo evidence gives finite residual/profile replay and first-pass
profile support, but zero promotable threshold/mass-scheme source rows.
