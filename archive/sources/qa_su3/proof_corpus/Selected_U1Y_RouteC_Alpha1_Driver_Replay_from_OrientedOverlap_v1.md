# Selected U1Y Route-C Alpha1 Driver Replay from OrientedOverlap v1

## Result

```text
status = U1Y_ROUTEC_ALPHA1_DRIVER_REPLAY_CLOSED_PRIMITIVE_C1_LAMBDA_OPEN
selected_N_alpha1_h_ext_value = true
du_dalpha1_equals_h_ext = true
alpha1_driver_verified = true
honest_dotD_validator_closed = true
primitive_C1_contractions_closed = false
lambda_12_closed = false
next_required_artifact = Selected_U1Y_RouteC_Primitive_C1_Contractions_or_Lambda12_Gate_v1
```

The alpha driver now closes at the oriented functional HYM/End0 layer.
`N_alpha1(h_ext)=1` promotes to `du/dalpha1=h_ext`, so the dotD replay
flags are theorem-derived rather than diagnostic.

## Requirements

```json
{
  "dotD_matrices_pass_when_flags_theorem_derived": true,
  "selected_1M_Dirac_shift": true,

## Promoted Value

```json
{
  "N_alpha1_h_ext": 1.0,
  "du_dalpha1": "h_ext",
  "h": "h_ext",
  "lambda_alpha1": 1.0,
  "reason": "The same-source matter-slot orientation, operator emission, and overlap normalization that the Chern-Weil gate named as missing are now theorem-derived at the oriented functional HYM/End0 layer.",
  "selected_value_emitted_by_this_theorem": true,
  "tangent_residual_l2": 0.0
}
```

## Theorem

The selected oriented terminal slot map, functional HYM/End0 operator emission, and overlap normalization close the exact hypothesis named by the Chern-Weil alpha1 value gate. Therefore the unique support value N_alpha1(h_ext)=1 promotes to selected source-strength value, so du/dalpha1=h_ext in the selected zero-mean HYM row gauge. Together with the closed transport derivative formula, this makes selected_dotD_source_verified and alpha1_driver_verified theorem-derived and the existing finite dotD matrices pass honest replay. This does not compute primitive C1 contractions, A_selected, b_selected, lambda_12, Yukawa data, or full SM closure.

## Guardrails

- This closes `alpha1_driver_verified`, not primitive C1 contractions.
- Do not promote `A_selected`, `b_selected`, `lambda_12`, Yukawas, or full SM closure here.
- Operator-layer Pic0 or gerbe/twisted replacement remains separately open.
