# SM Slot Functor OverlapKernel SourceEmission Import v1

Status: `SMSLOTFUNCTOR_OVERLAPKERNEL_SOURCE_PACKET_IMPORTED_DOWNSTREAM_OPERATOR_PAYLOADS_OPEN`.

## Result

The source-side matter-slot blocker has moved. Upstream now emits all six
selected SM-slot functor arrows, including the selected overlap/transfer kernel:

```text
For each selected matter triplet K_s, use the transported projector trace Gram <a,b>_s = Tr(P_s^sel a^* b P_s^sel)/3, with End0 generators normalized by ||rho_s(T_i)||_F=sqrt(2). The transfer representative is rho_s(T_i)/sqrt(2).
```

This imports selected `10_M`, `bar5_M`, `1_M=N^c`, q79 polarization
`U_10=I_3`, `U_bar5=F`, selected overlap normalization, and same-source
consistency at the functor/source level.

## Boundary

This does not close downstream operator payloads, primitive C1 contractions,
physical alpha1, Yukawa/CKM/PMNS/masses, or full SM/no-knob closure.

```json

  "Yukawa_CKM_PMNS_masses": true,
