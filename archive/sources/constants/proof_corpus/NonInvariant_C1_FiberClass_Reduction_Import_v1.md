# NonInvariant C1 FiberClass Reduction Import v1

## Result

The non-invariant C1 candidate search and fiber-class reduction are imported.

Closed:

```text
canonical zero repaired at candidate level: yes
finite non-invariant C1 candidate matrices emitted: yes
active shift (1,1) forced by finite support: yes
fixed qutrit fiber shifts 0,1,2 reduce to one gauge class: yes
all-fiber envelope retired as a fixed single-charge primitive: yes
observed flavor data used: no
```

## Finite Content

All nine active deck shifts were tested. Nonzero one-response C1 matrices occur
only for active shift `(1,1)`.

For fixed qutrit fiber shifts `0,1,2`:

```text
rank in u,d,e,nuD: 3
Frobenius norm in u,d,e,nuD: 0.5922903530864667
representative max entry: 0.34195899479289005
```

The all-fiber envelope has rank `1` in all four sectors and is not equivalent
to a fixed single-charge primitive.

## Meaning

This is a strong reduction, not final SM closure.

The finite search shows the candidate shape needed to defeat the canonical
mode-conservation zero. The source-selection audit shows that the only active
shift is forced and the remaining fixed fiber choices are gauge-equivalent.

What is not yet proved is that the selected q79/F,m=1 source emits this
non-invariant primitive, vertex correction, or basis transport at the operator
level.

## Not Closed

Still open:

```text
selected non-invariant C1 primitive or vertex source,
observable invariance under the fixed fiber class,
absolute fiber-origin gauge fix if needed,
selected basis transport theorem,
selected dotD source verification,
alpha1 driver verification,
honest replay without lifted flags,
Yukawa/CKM/PMNS magnitudes,
full SM closure.
```

## Next Gate

```text
Selected_C1_Response_Operator_Emission_or_FiberClass_Invariant_Observable_v1
```

It must either derive the active-shift `(1,1)` primitive from selected source
data or prove that the downstream C1/Yukawa observables are invariant under the
fixed qutrit fiber gauge class.
