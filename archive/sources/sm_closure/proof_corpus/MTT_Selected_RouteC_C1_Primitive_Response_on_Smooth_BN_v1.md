# MTT Selected Route-C C1 Primitive Response on Smooth BN

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEC_C1_PRIMITIVE_RESPONSE_ON_SMOOTH_BN_COMPUTED_SELECTED_PRIMITIVE_OPEN`

This computes the first natural C1 primitive-response contraction on the same
27-mode `B_N` basis: the finite translation-invariant trilinear tensor with
active `F3^2` mode conservation and qutrit fiber conservation.

## Result

- Nonzero primitive tensor slots: `729`.
- `u,d,e,nuD` one-response C1 matrices are all zero: `True`.

The zero result is not a numerical failure.  It is a clean selection-rule
result: the current `dotD` horizontal responses live in active mode `(-1,-1)`,
while the zero modes and Higgs zero mode live in `(0,0)`.  A one-response
trilinear term therefore violates the canonical active-mode conservation rule.

## Consequence

The next missing object is sharper than before.  Nonzero C1 response requires
one of:

- a selected non-invariant C1 primitive/vertex tensor,
- selected basis transport mixing zero and response modes,
- a same-source theorem deriving a different selected trilinear tensor,
- or selected full Iwasawa/Strominger data whose response support changes the
  active-mode selection rule.

No Yukawa, CKM, PMNS, or mass claim is made here.
