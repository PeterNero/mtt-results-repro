# MTT Selected RouteBIndependentPrimitiveRows or RouteAPhiFinBoundaryEmission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROUTEB_INDEPENDENTPRIMITIVEROWS_OR_ROUTEA_PHIFINBOUNDARYEMISSION_BUILT_PRECONDITIONS_REDUCED`.

This artifact reconciles the primitive-row execution frontier with the later
alpha1/dotD bridge.  Alpha1/dotD transport is no longer an active blocker:
`selected_dotD_source_verified`, `alpha1_driver_verified`, same-branch alpha1
derivative, and honest dotD replay are all theorem-derived by the compatible
bridge import.

The remaining primitive-row frontier is now exact: emit the dynamic
`Phi_fin^C1` trace/boundary source, or execute the 72 independent primitive
row kernels with selected provenance, exactness/error certificates, and no
residual-projector replay promotion.
