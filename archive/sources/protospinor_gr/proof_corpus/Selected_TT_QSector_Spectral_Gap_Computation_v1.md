# Selected TT QSector Spectral Gap Computation v1

## Result

The TT Q-sector gap is reduced to an explicit spectral eigenpacket problem.

The sourced QG structure is:

```text
E = Lichnerowicz operator on TT modes
A_int = internal noncoherent block
A = E op A_int
[E, A_int] = 0
```

and the TT Q-sector has a positive gap:

```text
lambda_star_TT > 0.
```

## Candidate Values Tested

The following values are available but not selected:

```text
1                      closure-metric convention
kappa_STF,int rows     response-stiffness convention
15                     exact Z64 branch gap
```

The exact Z64 value remains a powerful candidate only if the TT Q-sector is
proved same-branch with the Z64 central-circle tower. That identity is not yet
sourced.

## Remaining Gate

The next artifact is:

```text
Selected_TT_QSector_Eigenpacket
```

It must provide the selected bounded-geometry TT background or finite quotient,
the TT Q-sector projector and boundary conditions, the explicit operator/matrix
for `E`, and its lowest positive eigenvalue.
