# Selected Qa/SU3 Iwasawa Automorphy Cocycle Data or NoGo v1

## Purpose

This artifact tests whether the current corpus contains enough automorphy data
to realize the Iwasawa monad maps as global holomorphic sections.

## Source Scan

The selected heterotic source does identify:

```text
H_3(C)
Gamma subset H_3(C)
Gamma cocompact
left-invariant frame
```

It does not print:

```text
lattice generators,
complex coordinate action of Gamma,
factor of automorphy,
charge-to-factor map,
transition functions,
section-space solver.
```

The adjacent Theta Heisenberg nilmanifold source has real Heisenberg coordinate
and lattice data, but it is not a holomorphic `H_3(C)` line-bundle automorphy
packet and cannot be imported as such.

## Flat Character Test

A character-only ansatz

```text
a_q(gamma,z) = chi_q(gamma)
```

formally satisfies the group-cocycle shape and multiplicative law, but it is
flat.  It therefore cannot realize the eleven nonzero Chern-charge classes
needed by the monad maps.

```text
nonzero required charges: 11
flat character route rejected: yes
```

## NoGo

Current source data are insufficient to construct the automorphy cocycle.  This
does not retire the automorphy route; it says the current papers must be
augmented with the missing non-flat factor-of-automorphy data.

## Minimal Missing Data

```text
complex coordinate action of each Gamma generator
left/right quotient convention for section equivariance
charge-to-factor map q -> a_q(gamma,z)
cocycle check for a_q
proof that c1(a_q) equals q in the (a,b,c) basis
section-space solver for s_q(gamma.z)=a_q(gamma,z)s_q(z)
```

## Verdict

```text
current source cocycle data sufficient: no
literal constant route rejected: yes
flat character route rejected for nonzero charges: yes
Theta real Heisenberg import rejected: yes
automorphy route retired: no
source augmentation required: yes
explicit f,g constructed: no
g*f=0 proved: no
Qa/SU3 closed: no
target fitting used: no
```
