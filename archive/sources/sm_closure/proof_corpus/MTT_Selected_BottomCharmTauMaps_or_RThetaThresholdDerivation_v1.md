# MTT Selected BottomCharmTauMaps or RThetaThresholdDerivation v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_BOTTOMCHARMTAUMAPS_OR_RTHETATHRESHOLDDERIVATION_BUILT_NATIVE_RESIDUAL_INVENTORY_MAPS_OPEN`.

This artifact attacks the remaining b/c/tau mass-scheme maps.

```text
native/residual inventory closed       : true
accepted b/c/tau map rows              : 0
external import contract closed        : true
Rtheta precoefficient skeletons present: true
selected Rtheta derivation closed      : false
```

The useful gain is inventory and routing.  Native values and finite residuals
exist, and `Rtheta` has the right slot skeletons, but neither is an accepted
map source.  Next we need b/c/tau formula/table imports or a selected `Rtheta`
mass-scheme derivation.
