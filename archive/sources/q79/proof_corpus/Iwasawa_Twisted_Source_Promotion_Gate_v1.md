  We convert the open projective-twist source problem into an executable
  promotion gate.  The gate accepts a projective Iwasawa rho_E table only if a
  selected Deligne/Cech gerbe, B-field period table, discrete-torsion class, or
  finite HYM/Strominger twisted solve maps to the nontrivial zeta_3 finite
  Heisenberg cocycle and verifies Green-Schwarz Bianchi, Freed-Witten,
  coherent-projector, projective mesh, metric, and sector-map constraints.  The
  current qutrit projective magnetic carrier is rejected as unselected and
  incomplete: it has the correct central cocycle but not the selected gerbe
  period map or twisted sector projectors.

# Purpose

The source hunt found:

```text
finite projective cocycle arithmetic = closed,
string/flux gerbe/Bianchi infrastructure = aligned,
selected gerbe-to-cocycle source map = open.
```

This paper makes the missing object executable.

# Promotion Packet

The validator is:

```text
scripts/validate_iwasawa_twisted_source_promotion.py
```

It consumes:

```text
IwasawaTwistedSourcePromotionPacket.v1
```

and requires:

```text
selected_twist_verified = true,
fixed_topological_sector = true,
no observed flavor inputs,
no use of the projective prototype as selected,
no use of the zeta_3 twist as a q79 replacement.
```

# Required Cocycle

The finite arithmetic must match the certified qutrit route:

```text
base group = F_3^2,
omega order = 3,
commutator rank over F_3 = 2,
finite Heisenberg extension order = 27,
center order = 3,
ordinary bundle coboundary possible = false.
```

# Required Source

The source must be one of:

```text
Deligne/Cech gerbe,
B-field period table,
discrete-torsion class,
finite HYM/Strominger twisted solve.
```

It must verify:

```text
selected by MTT,
fixed differential cohomology class,
map to central cocycle,
Green-Schwarz Bianchi,
Freed-Witten consistency,
twisted sector retained by the coherent projector,
period denominator 3.
```

# Required Finite Validators

The same packet must pass:

```text
projective rho_E mesh validator,
rho_E metric validator,
sector-map validator.
```

The projective validator must report a nontrivial central twist.  Strict
ordinary gluing is only the trivial projective case and is not enough.

# Current Result

The current projective magnetic carrier:

```text
passes projective mesh arithmetic,
has nontrivial zeta_3 central phases,
does not pass selected-source promotion.
```

It is missing:

```text
selected gerbe/B-field period data,
explicit holonomy map to the zeta_3 cocycle,
Bianchi/Freed-Witten certificate for that twist,
twisted sector projectors,
selected twisted D_E and dotD response.
```

# Consequence

This is useful progress because the open problem is no longer vague.

The exact next datum is:

```text
a filled IwasawaTwistedSourcePromotionPacket.v1.
```

Only after that packet passes should the projective route feed primitive C1
contractions, Yukawa matrices, CKM magnitudes, or SM masses.
