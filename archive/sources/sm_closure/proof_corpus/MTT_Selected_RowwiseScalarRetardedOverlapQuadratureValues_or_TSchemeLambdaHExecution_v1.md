# MTT Selected RowwiseScalarRetardedOverlapQuadratureValues or TSchemeLambdaHExecution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ROWWISESCALARRETARDEDOVERLAPQUADRATUREVALUES_OR_TSCHEMELAMBDAHSOURCEEXECUTION_BUILT_SPECTRAL_SUPPORT_STRICT_QUADRATURE_EQUALITY_OPEN`.

This packet executes the strongest scalar operation currently justified by
selected data: pair the selected family spectral projectors with the selected
first-response Hermitian operator,
`L_spectral_support(s,g)=abs(Tr(P_s,g H1_s))`.

Result:

```text
selected family projector basis closed      : true
selected basis-map rows available           : 9
selected spectral support scalar rows       : 9
strict L_rowlocal rows accepted             : 0
selected T_scheme rows emitted              : false
selected lambda_H payload emitted           : false
accepted selected K rows                    : 0
```

The nine charged spectral support scalars are:

```text
- u.gen1: 1.367835979172
- u.gen2: 0.683917989586
- u.gen3: 0.683917989586
- d.gen1: 1.367835979172
- d.gen2: 0.683917989586
- d.gen3: 0.683917989586
- e.gen1: 1.367835979172

```

This is real progress, but not final value closure.  The packet rejects three
shortcuts: ordered-basis diagonals, correction-matrix eigen/diagonal replay,
and empirical K import.  To promote the nine support rows to strict physical
`L_rowlocal` rows, the next artifact must either prove the selected
retarded-overlap/spectral-pairing identity or execute independent selected
finite quadrature values `Q_sel`.  `T_scheme.*` and `lambda_H` still also need
selected source rows before any ten `K_threshold` rows can close.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_RetardedOverlapSpectralPairingLemma_or_IndependentQuadratureValues_v1`.
