The terminal selector and the selected ordered AH/good-cover source now bind to
the same object: `g3 / L3-K2`, with `L=(1,-2,0)` and `L^2=(2,-4,0)`. This
closes the base-order/AH-binding part at the ordered Chern/H1/ordinary-curvature
layer under the explicit terminal admissible-section principle.

## Slot Map

```json
{
  "10_M_clock": "I_3",
  "bar5_M_shift": "F",
  "one_M_Dirac_shift": {
    "1_M": "N^c",
    "route": [
      "d",
      "nuD"
    ]
  },
  "phase": [
    "u",
    "e"
  ],
  "shift": [
    "d",
    "nuD"
  ]
}
```

The slot map is support-complete, not yet selected same-branch operator emission.
The required next proof is the branch-coherence selector or finite validator replay.

## Theorem

The selected ordered AH/good-cover source packet and the terminal-monad selector refer to the same L3-K2 source: L=(1,-2,0), L^2=(2,-4,0), selected as g3/L3-K2 under the explicit terminal admissible-section principle. Therefore the terminal lane, standard-lattice equivalent, base factor order, and AH/good-cover binding are closed at the ordered Chern/H1/ordinary-curvature/stability layer. The SU(5)/E6 slot map is support-complete: U_10=I_3, U_bar5=F, and 1_M=N^c route to phase={u,e} and shift={d,nuD}. This does not yet prove same-branch selected operator emission, operator-layer Pic0, overlap normalization, alpha1 transfer, or lambda_12.

## Guardrails

- The terminal admissible-section principle is still an explicit principle, not yet an unconditional MTT axiom.
- The ordered-layer AH binding does not close operator-layer Pic0.
- Slot-map support does not count as same-branch selected operator emission.
- Do not compute `alpha1`, `lambda_12`, masses, CKM, or threshold matches from this artifact.
