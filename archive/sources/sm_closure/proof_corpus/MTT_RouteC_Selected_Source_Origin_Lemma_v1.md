# MTT Route-C Selected Source-Origin Lemma v1

## Result

The full `RouteCSelectedSourceOriginLemma` is not closed yet.  The proof is
advanced to a sharper reduction:

```text
RouteCSelectedSourceOriginLemma
  = fixed-sector MTT/Strominger/S3/GS source support
  + FiniteEmissionMorphism_Phi_fin.
```

The first component is now supported by the corpus and repo certificates.  The
remaining missing object is the finite emission morphism from the selected
Strominger/HYM minimizer to the exact Route-C operator payload.

## Superset Classification

`SUPERSET_CONVERGENCE_PARTIAL_PROOF`

This is not a straight path.  It combines MTT Strominger selection, selected
S3 differential cohomology, visible Green-Schwarz support, q79/F,m=1 Route-C
branch data, Appell-Humbert automorphy, and twisted Chan-Paton/gerbe structure
into one locked target.

## Selected Branch

- branch: `current_q79_orientation`
- q label: `79`
- torsion label m: `1`
- orientation: `F`

## Gate Matrix

- `G1_fixed_topological_sector_named`: `PASS`
- `G2_MTT_Strominger_selection_available`: `PASS`
- `G3_same_source_support_converges`: `PASS`
- `G4_minimizer_to_finite_packet_morphism`: `OPEN`
- `G5_operator_payload_emitted`: `OPEN`

## Missing Morphism

`Phi_fin`

Domain:

```text
selected MTT Strominger/HYM minimizer in fixed q79/F,m=1 S3/GS sector
```

Codomain:

```text
finite Route-C packet with rho_E, metric, sector maps, D_E, Riesz/gap, reduced Green, dotD, and C1 tensors
```

The morphism must commute with:

- S3 flat Deligne/Cech restriction
- Green-Schwarz Bianchi row
- Appell-Humbert automorphy/line-bundle transition factors
- twisted Chan-Paton projective module
- Route-C finite validator basis and q79/F orientation

Current missing pieces:

- explicit map Phi_fin from the selected Strominger/HYM minimizer to finite rho_E transition data
- proof that Phi_fin preserves q79/F,m=1 branch orientation and the S3/GS class
- error/gap certificate identifying the Route-C finite packet as the Galerkin trace of the minimizer

Operator payload still not emitted:

- rho_E transition data
- Hermitian metric
- sector projectors
- D_E action slots for Q,u,d,L,e,N,H
- Riesz projectors, complement gaps, reduced Green operators
- dotD_alpha1 matrices and horizontal responses
- primitive C1 overlap tensors

Acceptance tests for the next artifact:

- selected_source_verified becomes a theorem-derived field, not a lifted flag
- D_E, dotD, Riesz/Green, and residual validators pass honestly
- finite truncation error is bounded by the selected Hessian/Riesz gap
- primitive C1 overlap tensors are emitted or explicitly reduced to a subsequent overlap theorem

## Theorem

`RouteCSelectedSourceOriginLemmaReduction` is proved:

The selected source-origin lemma is reduced to one missing object: the finite emission morphism. The fixed topological sector, S3/GS source support, and MTT Strominger selection theorem are present; what is not yet present is the canonical finite trace that emits the selected operator payload.
