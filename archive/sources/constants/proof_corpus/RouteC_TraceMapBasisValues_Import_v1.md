Status: `ROUTEC_TRACEMAP_BASIS_VALUES_IMPORTED_DYNAMIC_DOTD_BINDING_OPEN`.

Accepted now:

```text
stationary trace-map values = True
basis stage accepted        = True
selected basis rows         = 19/19
```

Primitive stage:

```text
primitive row ids locked = 72
primitive rows executed  = False
blockers                 = ['selected stationary basis rows are filled, but dynamic dotD trace binding is still open', 'primitive rows require the differentiated C1 trace operator, not only stationary projectors', 'alpha1/dotD transport derivative terms must be attached before C1 primitive contractions can be selected']
```

Dynamic C1 status:

```text
dynamic C1 trace accepted = False
dynamic flags             = {'alpha1_driver_verified': False, 'boundary_cancellation_for_dynamic_C1_trace': False, 'finite_27_mode_replay_closed_without_symbolic_transport': False, 'physical_first_variation_identity': False, 'selected_dotD_source_verified': False}
