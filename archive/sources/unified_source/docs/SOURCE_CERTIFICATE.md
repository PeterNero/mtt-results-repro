# Same-Source Certificate Contract

This repository uses the already proved finite representation-diagram theorem
as its integration language. The theorem is not reproved here.

## Homotopy-Limit Target

Let \(D:I\to\mathcal C\) be the typed diagram whose nodes are the selected
geometric, differential, operator and physical realizations. The unified MTT
reference object is expected to be

\[
R_{\mathrm{MTT}}=\operatorname{holim}_{i\in I}D(i).
\]

For the favored hypothesis, a point of this homotopy limit contains compatible
realizations of:

```text
eta9 differential/Picard source
  -> visible-hidden Hull-Strominger endpoint
  -> augmented cyclic deformation complex
  -> Hodge/operator realization
  -> finite spectral/Galerkin carrier
  -> SM, QFT, GR, QM-recorder and worldsheet readouts.
```

The derived solution germ in `HYPOTHESIS.md` is the proposed source node. The
homotopy-limit diagram is the certificate that all lower nodes really came
from it.

## Selection Test

For the restriction from the full diagram to already known lower data, inspect
the homotopy fiber:

| Fiber | Meaning |
|---|---|
| empty | incompatible source candidate or no-go |
| one gauge orbit | selected same-source promotion |
| finitely many orbits | unresolved discrete branch |
| positive-dimensional fiber | remaining continuous source freedom |

Calling a source "one" requires one gauge orbit or an explicitly declared
finite ambiguity. It does not require every presentation to contain one field.

## Required Nodes

1. `SOURCE`: selected q79 derived solution germ and source hash.
2. `AUGMENTED`: \(\mathcal Y_\bullet\), pairing, domains and higher products.
3. `AUT`: automorphism and representation readout.
4. `COH`: cohomology, index and family readout.
5. `OP`: Hodge Hessian, Green operator and spectral data.
6. `FIN`: finite qutrit-27/rank-102 realization.
7. `GR`: coframe/torsion low-energy realization.
8. `QFT`: cyclic BV/QME and state realization at its declared tier.
9. `REC`: recorder and operational quantum realization.
10. `WS`: heterotic worldsheet realization.

## Required Edge Data

Every claimed edge must declare which structures it preserves:

- differential or superconnection;
- gauge action and stabilizers;
- connection and holonomy;
- cyclic/Hermitian pairing;
- higher products;
- Hessian, domain and Green operator;
- normalization and units;
- index and orientation;
- error or exactness certificate.

No edge may silently switch the shared circle, metric, connection, branch or
normalization.

## Promotion Packet

A promotable packet must contain:

1. one source point or source orbit;
2. its realization at every claimed node;
3. every edge map or correspondence;
4. a zero compatibility residual, or an interval enclosure and uniqueness
   bound;
5. gauge and branch stabilizers;
6. remaining kernel dimension and spectral gap;
7. source, code, artifact and environment hashes;
8. held-out downstream tests and a no-target-selector certificate.

Agreement of final numbers without the source point and edge maps is profile
replay, not a same-source theorem.

## Physical Source Ingestion

The seven `UST.G1E` reverse-representability rows are compiled from:

```text
U_eta9
W9_tau
one common positive chamber
one tangent-connection convention
zero or one separately bound positive normalization ray
T_fin as a same-source readout certificate
```

`K`, the physical Hessian, Green operator and Galerkin coefficients are derived
outputs. They are never accepted as replacement primitive rows.

Evidence grades are `PASS`, `FAIL`, `PARTIAL`, `CONDITIONAL`, `OPEN` and
`NOT_SOURCE`. Only seven `PASS` rows, a normalization state of `DERIVED` or
`BOUND`, one source-orbit id and locked hashes permit promotion. Rows from
different source-orbit ids require explicit transports preserving every used
structure. Without those transports, combining the rows is rejected as source
splicing.

The exact machine contract is
`state/ust_g3_source_ingestion.schema.json`.

## Spectral-to-Common-Chamber Certificate

The common positive chamber row is compiled by `UST.G3D`; it is not supplied
as a fitted metric choice. A physical packet must contain exactly:

1. the q79 base rows (H^2=2), (H\cdot\delta=0), and
   \(\delta^2=-4\);
2. one selected visible rank-three spectral module;
3. one selected twisted hidden rank-nine module, or a unitary orbit of three
   selected stable rank-three factors;
4. local freeness, determinant, relative semistability and equivariant descent;
5. the canonical q79 gaps `a_V=2`, `a_W=2/3` and certified fixed-`omega_1`
   slope upper bounds `M_E`;
6. one rational `common_t` strictly above every compiled threshold;
7. one source hash and no empirical metric input.

The hidden degree-three transformed support is not accepted as the physical
rank-nine row. Threshold equality is also rejected because the proof requires
strict negativity. The machine contract and compiler are
`state/ust_g3d_common_gauduchon_chamber.schema.json` and
`verify_ust_g3d_common_gauduchon_chamber.py`.

## Common Scale Quotient

After the relative target metric is selected, one common positive action scale
may remain. Multiplying the complete physical residual norm by this scale
preserves the kernel, projectors, eigenspaces, spectral ratios, normalized
finite operators and Newton correction. It rescales absolute eigenvalues and
the inverse Green operator in opposite directions. Independent target-sector
weights are not unit conventions and must remain explicit source rows.

## Relative Target-Metric Selection

Compatible target metrics form the positive cone cut out by the complete
source structure. The relative metric is selected only when this cone has one
positive ray. The G3C certificate compiles exact homogeneous equations of the
form

\[
\sum_r c_r L_r^T W R_r=0
\]

for the full symmetric metric `W`, including cross-block entries. Exact
nullity one plus a positive witness closes all relative weights. Nullity `d>1`
leaves `d-1` relative directions after the common-scale quotient.

Every constraint must carry the same source hash. A finite readout or
Galerkin calculation remains finite-tier unless an analytic commutant theorem
or exact completeness intertwiner identifies it with the continuum cone. The
machine contract is `state/ust_g3c_target_metric.schema.json`.

## Bound Repair Metric Tier

The complete seven-lane residual now has a declared minimal orthogonal metric
made from endpoint-induced `L2` pairings with equal lane weights. It introduces
zero fitted parameters and may be used to define the repair Hessian once the
endpoint is supplied. Its certificate tier is `BOUND_STRUCTURAL_REPAIR_METRIC`.

This is weaker than a G3C derivation. It does not prove that source symmetry
forces those relative weights, and it does not identify the repair norm with a
Lorentzian, BV or ten-dimensional action. Papers and downstream packets must
preserve that distinction.

## Full-Hessian Finite Transfer

An exact `T_fin` certificate for the corrected Hessian must include:

1. isometry of the retained system map;
2. isometry of the residual-target map;
3. forward `K` intertwining;
4. a reducing finite image for `K_f^dagger K_f`, or an independently verified
   adjoint-square relation.

For approximate transport the error budget must include base-Hessian defect,
forward-`K` defect and adjoint leakage. A forward intertwiner with zero
`K`-defect can still fail to transport `K^dagger K` when its image is not
reducing.
