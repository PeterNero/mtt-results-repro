# MTT Selected ThresholdMassSchemeValues or CorrelatedLikelihoodSourceImport v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_THRESHOLDMASSSCHEMEVALUES_OR_CORRELATEDLIKELIHOODSOURCEIMPORT_BUILT_RESIDUAL_VALUES_SOURCE_IMPORT_OPEN`.

This artifact emits finite residual rows for the threshold/mass-scheme layer.

```text
residual rows = 15
all finite    = True
```

This closes the residual-value audit only. It does not promote the residuals to
accepted threshold matching or mass-scheme conversion values.

The correlated likelihood source import was also checked and remains absent.

Promotion decision:

```text
residual value audit closed: true
accepted threshold/mass-scheme layer closed: false
correlated likelihood source imported: false
true SM equivalence: open
```

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_AcceptedThresholdMassSchemeSourceRows_or_NoKnobValueDerivation_v1`.
