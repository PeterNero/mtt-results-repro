# MTT Selected DynamicC1TransferTensor ValueEmission or HonestGalerkinC1Run v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_DYNAMICC1TRANSFERTENSOR_VALUEEMISSION_OR_HONESTGALERKINC1RUN_ATTEMPTED_EXISTING_VALUES_OPEN`.

The strict acceptance target is now replayed against the current source
inventory:

```text
target coordinate system = 4 sectors x 3x3 complex = 72 real coordinates
conditional rank         = 2
conditional A^T A        = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
conditional A^T b        = [12.0, 12.0]
conditional deltaTheta   = [1.0, 1.0]
```

Lane A is supported but not emitted: static provenance, stationary
projector/Riesz/Green, alpha1/dotD, and the conditional tensor are in place,
but selected differentiated `Phi_fin^C1`, primitive overlaps, `b_selected`, and
sector matrices are still absent.

Lane B is also open: the honest Galerkin C1 manifest still reports
`OPEN_C1_PRIMITIVE_CONTRACTIONS_MISSING`.

So the remaining object is sharply identified: a selected primitive C1 tensor /
Hessian source map, or an honest selected Galerkin C1 execution, in the same
72-real coordinate system.

No observed masses, mixings, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target residuals
are used as selectors.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PrimitiveC1Tensor_HessianSourceMap_or_HonestGalerkinC1Execution_v1`.
