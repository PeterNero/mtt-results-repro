# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B23 Cross Use Universal Parameter Admissibility v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B23_CROSS_USE_UNIVERSAL_PARAMETER_ADMISSIBILITY_BUILT`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B23-RETIRE-U-DYN-OR-BRIDGE-AUDIT`

## Theorem

A provisional parameter is admissible under the superset strategy when it is:

```text
declared once,
global rather than sector-specific,
shared across at least two independent uses,
source-derived or calibrated once,
then reused unchanged for every other sector.
```

This is legitimate universal-parameter closure if it works, but it is not strict
no-knob closure until the parameter is derived from selected MTT source data.

## Current Ledger

```text
u_dyn  = provisional dynamic transfer/source-strength bridge
u_phys = provisional physical unit/metrology bridge
```

Allowed:

```text
fix u_dyn from one independent sector, then predict weak angle or C1 elsewhere
fix u_phys from one independent unit/anchor sector, then predict alpha/weak links
```

Forbidden:

```text
retune u_dyn per weak angle, CKM, PMNS, Yukawa, or alpha
use observed weak angle to choose u_dyn and then call weak angle predicted
call any calibrated parameter strict no-knob
```
