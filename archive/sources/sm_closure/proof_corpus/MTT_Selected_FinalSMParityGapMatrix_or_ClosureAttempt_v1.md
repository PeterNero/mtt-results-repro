# MTT Selected FinalSMParityGapMatrix or ClosureAttempt v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FINALSMPARITYGAPMATRIX_OR_CLOSUREATTEMPT_BUILT_OPEN_GATES_SHARPENED`.

This artifact evaluates the closure attempt after patched dynamic C1 integration.
It does not move backward: patched dynamic C1 remains ready and removed from the
patched SM-parity blocker list.

## Result

```text
patched SM-parity closed = False
true SM equivalence      = False
no-knob closure          = False
```

## SM-Parity Blockers

The remaining SM-parity blockers are:

1. common-scale Yukawa/Higgs transport,
2. covariance/profile-likelihood or tolerance-policy execution,
3. final integrated empirical replay audit,
4. selected SM packet certificate integration.

QFT/GR/QM recovery interfaces are promoted to the true-equivalence lane, while
unpatched dynamic C1 and full constant derivation remain no-knob blockers.
