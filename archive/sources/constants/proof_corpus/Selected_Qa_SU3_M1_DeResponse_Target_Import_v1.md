# Selected Qa/SU3 m=1 DeResponse Target Import

## Result

The time-oriented `m=1`, `q=79`, `F` representative gives a coherent
conditional `de_response` target.

The imported q79 result says:

```text
m=1 representative fixed: true
finite de_response stack coherent: true
conditional lifted HYM gate passes: true
conditional lifted promotion passes: true
```

So the next blocker is not the finite matrix shape.  The blocker is source origin.

## Honest Failure

The current repo-level smoke files still fail the honest validators.  The
`dotD` response validator rejects both the `q79` and conjugate `q369` smoke
packets because every sector still lacks source justification flags such as:

```text
selected_dotD_source_verified
alpha1_driver_verified
```

That is exactly the right failure.  It prevents temporary lifted selected-source
flags from being mistaken for proof data.

## Next Object

The next required object is:

```text
Selected_Qa_SU3_M1_Selected_Source_Origin_v1
```

It must supply the actual selected visible bundle or twisted-gerbe source,
Freed-Witten cancellation, projector retention, full Deligne/Cech or B-field
period data, and repo-level selected `D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green` files.  Only then
can the coherent conditional target become proof data.
