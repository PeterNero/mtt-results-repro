# MTT Selected PhiFinC1 ActionRestriction or BoundarySource Emission v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHIFINC1_ACTIONRESTRICTION_OR_BOUNDARYSOURCE_EMISSION_BUILT_MEASURE_RETIRED_SOURCE_OPEN`.

The finite measure-normalization blocker is retired.  The selected qutrit Weyl
trace theorem supplies the finite trace/Frobenius measure; Route A no longer
needs a separate measure axiom.

The remaining unpatched dynamic C1 gate is physical source emission:

- `Phi_fin^C1`/action restricts to the selected finite Weyl quotient
- no extra physical boundary/source term is emitted
- same-source `R_Z`, `R_X`, and `b_selected` are emitted

If those clauses are emitted, the existing replay promotes
`A_selected=[[12,0],[0,12]]`, `b_selected=[12,12]`, and
`deltaTheta_C1=[1,1]` without using observed constants as selectors.
