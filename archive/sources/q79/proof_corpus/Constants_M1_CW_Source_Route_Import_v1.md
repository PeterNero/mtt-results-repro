title: "Constants M1 CW Source Route Import"
version: v1

# Result

The latest constants-repo Chern-Weil/operator-source attempt aligns with the
q79 rank-two V_alpha route.

The primary route imported from constants is:

```text
non_split_rank2_V_alpha_extension
```

with the same target already present in q79:

```text
L = (1,-2,0),
L^2 = (2,-4,0),
c2(V_alpha) = 4 alpha_1.
```

# H1 Bridge

The q79 finite h1 packet is compatible with the constants template:

```text
h1(X,L^2) = 8,
nonzero Ext class = true,
unselected fixture currently,
promotes if selected source is supplied.
```

So in q79, the next blocker is not another h1 algebra calculation.  The h1
packet is waiting for a selected source certificate.

# Payload Order

The common payload order begins with:

```text
selected_source_certificate
selected_visible_bundle_sheaf_or_routec_source
chern_weil_or_equivalent_operator_row_derivation
```

Only after those can we legitimately fill:

```text
D_E,
Riesz/Green,
same-branch dotD_alpha1,
primitive C1 contractions.
```

# Guardrail

This import does not promote selected-source flags, does not construct D_E/dotD,
and does not close SM flavor.  It closes alignment between repos and points the
next computation at the selected ordered integral Cech/automorphy source.
