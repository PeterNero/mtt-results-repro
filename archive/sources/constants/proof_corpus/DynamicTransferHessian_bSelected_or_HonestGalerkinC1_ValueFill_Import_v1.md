# DynamicTransferHessian bSelected or HonestGalerkinC1 ValueFill Import v1

Status: `DYNAMIC_TRANSFER_HESSIAN_BSELECTED_VALUEFILL_IMPORTED_CONDITIONAL_GRAM_EXACT_SOURCE_OPEN`.

## Exact Conditional Gram

The conditional Weyl-pair packet is now fixed in a 72-real coordinate system:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
||b||^2 = 24.0
deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0]
residual norm = 0.0
condition number = 1.0
```

This removes the linear-algebra obstruction.

## Boundary

The packet is still conditional. Promotion requires same-source dynamic
transfer/Hessian/`b_selected` identity or honest selected Galerkin C1
contractions in this 72-real coordinate system.

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or lifted
flags are used as selectors.
