# MTT Selected Normalized Determinant Action from MTT Hessian or Independent Gauge Profile Test v1

## Trace selection

The existing finite Weyl trace theorem extends to each finite carrier used by A73: unitary
conjugation invariance forces `Tr/16`, `Tr/7`, and `Tr/4`. Therefore the nontrivial `Z7` and Lens
projectors have forced normalized traces `6/7` and `3/4`. These coefficients are not knobs.

## Independent legacy test

The frozen A72 formula was transported from `172.559088345398 GeV` to Buttazzo's `Mt` scale with
the SM one-loop beta vector. Only the common normalization was fixed, from `SU2`; neither relative
ratio was fitted. Propagating the published `Mt`, `MW`, and `alpha_s` uncertainties gives

```text
chi2 = 3.70498824192283 for 2 degrees of freedom,
p = 0.156845486452729,
marginal pulls = [-1.5953073805097993, 0.9885110009558816].
```

The frozen formula is compatible with this older independent NNLO profile at the declared `p>0.05`
threshold. This is not a modern ppm-level confirmation; higher-loop transport uncertainty was not
needed for the compatibility pass and is not included.

## Remaining physical gate

Trace normalization, projector ranks, algebraic one-action existence, formula freezing, and legacy
compatibility are closed. Strict promotion still requires the selected physical MTT kinetic Hessian
to equal the A73 block action, coemit the q79 chord and projector routing, and exclude extra relative
counterterm/boundary contributions.
