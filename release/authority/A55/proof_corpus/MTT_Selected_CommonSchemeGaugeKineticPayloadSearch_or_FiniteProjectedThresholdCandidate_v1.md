# MTT Selected Common-Scheme Gauge Kinetic Payload Search or Finite Projected Threshold Candidate v1

## Payload Found

The exact tree-level gauge kinetic payload was already present but had not been separated from the
threshold search. The completed finite triple gives, in `(U1_GUT,SU2,SU3)` order,

```text
Tr_F(T_a^2) = (6,6,6).
```

These are three accepted same-scheme source rows with zero new parameters. They prove universal
tree-level normalization, not the observed non-universal low-energy couplings.

## Finite Projected Candidate

The selected 27-mode base spectrum gives one-copy

```text
L = 4 log((2*pi/3)^2) + 4 log(2*(2*pi/3)^2) = 14.6008251660996.
```

If that same base operator factorizes over the physical circle/lens/nil carrier flag, quotienting the
shared circle gives multiplicities `(2,2,3)` and determinant vector

```text
(29.2016503321991, 29.2016503321991, 43.8024754982986).
```

Its U1 entry exactly reproduces the independently proved `P_perp` quotient determinant. The premise
that one selected gauge threshold operator emits the full factorized vector is still open.

## Numerical Test

The clean candidate does not become exact under either sign of the canonical `1/(8*pi^2)` response,
nor under SM-beta supertrace weighting, at any common one-loop scale. At the unique scale
`Q=1.00753628713e+13 GeV` where `g1_GUT=g2`, the required SU3 response is

```text
chi_required = -0.0302786020142925
chi_required / (1/(8*pi^2)) = -2.39070258959275.
```

Thus the determinant spectrum is not by itself a physical gauge kinetic payload. Its sign and weight
must come from the gauge-field second variation or graded representation supertrace.

## Exact Remaining Object

The repository has an exact U1 quotient determinant, a scoped SU2 flat-FP cancellation, and exact
SU3 internal `log(2008)`, but they use different domains or response conventions and cannot be added.
The emitted template requires the missing common operation

```text
Delta_a = FP Str(T_a^2 exp(-t D_source^2)),
```

equivalently the second variation of one selected regularized action with respect to all three gauge
fields. One operator, grading, trace, zero-mode policy, regulator, scale and scheme must generate all
three rows. Heterotic threshold literature confirms these weights are model-specific BPS/bundle data,
not a universal multiplier: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09442 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5566.
