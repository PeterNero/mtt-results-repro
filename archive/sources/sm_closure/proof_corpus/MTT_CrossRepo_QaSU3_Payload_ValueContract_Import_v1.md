# MTT Cross-Repo Qa/SU3 Payload Value Contract Import v1

## Result

This packet imports the latest `mtt-qa-su3-packet-proof` frontier into the main SM-closure verifier.

It does not close the actual dynamic Qa/SU3 payload values. It replaces the vague blocker with a finite, machine-checkable contract.

## Finite closure alternatives

Route A: emit the nine source-object exports for `S_QaSU3^BN27`.

1. `full_F3xF3_rank_slot_carrier`
2. `C_tau_operator`
3. `PhiFin_DE_operator`
4. `operator_coemission_and_commutation`
5. `kernel_shared_circle_policy`
6. `trace_policy_and_index_scale`
7. `finitepart_log92160000_identity`
8. `not_routec_import_provenance`
9. `theorem_derived_selected_source_flags`

Route B: emit the seven equivalent connection-value exports. Current progress:
`4/7` accepted by fresh raw-field validation of the terminal finite-cochain
packet plus the `D_E`/Riesz/Green kernel-trace export packet.

1. `typed_f_sections` - accepted
2. `typed_g_sections` - accepted
3. `cech_transitions_and_cocycles`
4. `g_after_f_zero_and_exactness_certificate` - accepted
5. `selected_HYM_or_projective_connection_coefficients`
6. `BN27_operator_export_to_DE_Riesz_Green_kernel_trace` - accepted
7. `no_lifted_flags_replay_audit`

## Preserved support values

The import preserves the exact support values already found:

- `oriented_abs_sector_product = 92160000`
- `oriented_abs_sector_logdet_exact = log(92160000)`
- `oriented_nonzero_positive_rows = 16`
- `plus_sector_product = 9600`
- `minus_sector_product = 9600`
- `N_alpha1(h_ext) = 1`
- `tangent_residual_l2 = 0`

These are not promoted as selected payload values until Route A or Route B is source-owned.

## Theorem

`CrossRepoQaSU3PayloadValueContractImportTheorem`: the newest Qa/SU3 packet repository reduces the main-repo actual dynamic Qa/SU3 payload blocker to a finite alternative. Either the nine `S_QaSU3^BN27` source-object exports are emitted, or the seven equivalent typed Cech/HYM/projective connection exports are emitted. Existing support values are retained only as support until one export set is source-owned.

Therefore the active frontier is no longer an unspecified actual-packet gap; it is the selected source-object/connection-value emission contract. After fresh validation, the strict equivalent connection route is at `4/7`; the remaining strict rows are Cech transitions/cocycles, selected HYM/projective coefficients, and no-lift replay.
