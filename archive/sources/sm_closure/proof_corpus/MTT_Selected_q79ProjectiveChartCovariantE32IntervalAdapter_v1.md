# MTT Selected q79 Projective-Chart-Covariant E32 Interval Adapter v1

## Theorem

A123 already proves the exact overlap formulas

```text
t_z=-(L0+L2*t_y)/L1,
U_z=(L2/L1)^3 U_y,
det(T_5)=-1.
```

The validated system now consumes the selected chart as an explicit source
coordinate.  In the native `z` chart it uses the exact homogeneous sextic,
quadratic splitting factor, Gauss-Manin reduction, and residue numerator

```text
constant = L2 (dL0 L2-dL2 L0),
linear   = L2 (dL1 L2-dL2 L1).
```

The three `L2=0` chart walls are interval-isolated.  Their minimum pairwise
torus separation is `0.3557180255209726`
and their minimum clearance from all 90 nodal values is
`0.01596996567542382`.

## First complete native z execution

The frozen z-queue head `d048/selected_046`, coefficient `+3`, is certified
through the entire independent pipeline:

```text
node Jacobian lower = 132.8993967366463
tail segments       = 384
tail radius         = 4.079888063675264e-10
main steps          = 68 accepted / 18 rejected
main radius         = 7.936130431453395e-08
full radius         = 1.126418225361192e-07
floating difference = 2.752230495528148e-12
```

The independent A131 floating center is contained, and the A134 fallback is
met.  A151 therefore retires the generic z-chart infrastructure blocker.  It
does not certify the remaining z rows, the 71-thimble weighted sum, or the
fixed-carrier exact branch.

## Provenance guard

Earlier y packets retain historical engine hash
`1b99c9920f60936ba2ce600ebbdb19645122643e2bd81f7d321e2f4449cfb33b`.  The current chart-parametric source has hash
`2b96ca4ffba10106c75822ee0b2ca13e2455cb435d008294d70d5ae19703099b` and still defaults to `y`.  This is stronger than a
bare source supersession: a machine audit reverses only the explicit chart
parameterization and strict chart-consistency guards and reconstructs the
recorded historical hashes exactly:

```text
transport = 1b99c9920f60936ba2ce600ebbdb19645122643e2bd81f7d321e2f4449cfb33b
main      = 13702262eaa3463cb628acab1d703e949b5c4663be077bfadfbf3000bf244a98
full      = b1dc64fb1b8c961897209ca38fbf15949da4942a5547230a58b2ab16b4cbb3c9
```

Thus the new source is a byte-certified conservative extension on its `y`
specialization.  This remains not a claim that old packets were rerun.  No
observed Standard Model value enters the construction.
