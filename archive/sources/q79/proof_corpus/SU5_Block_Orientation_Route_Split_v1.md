  We compare two possible continuations of the SU(5) qutrit program.  The
  conditional monolithic tensor route assumes a selected whole-multiplet
  polarization, 10_M clock and bar5_M shift, which gives T_u=I_3 and T_d=F
  or F*.  The block-factorized trivial-Higgs route instead assigns qutrit
  orientations sector-by-sector: Q,L carry one orientation while u,d,e,N carry
  the conjugate orientation.  These are not the same source.  The current
  block packets are coherent for SM trivial-Higgs pairings, but they do not
  source the monolithic SU(5) tensor.  Therefore the next proof must close
  either a selected high-scale SU(5)/E6 source for the tensor, or a selected
  sector-resolved C1/dotD/overlap packet for the block route.

  SU(5) Block Orientation Route Split

# Purpose

The previous finite tensor calculation closed this conditional statement:

```text
10_M clock, bar5_M shift
=> T_u = I_3, T_d = F or F*.
```

The block-factorized qutrit route has a different structure.  With the Higgs
kept on a trivial line, the finite qutrit invariant rule requires:

```text
s_left + s_right = 0 mod 3.
```

So the current q79 branch packet assigns:

```text
Q,L       -> orientation 1,
u,d,e,N   -> orientation 2,
H         -> orientation 0.
```

The conjugate branch reverses `1` and `2`.

# Multiplet Coherence Check

Under the q79 block packet:

```text
10_M  = Q + u + e  has orientations 1,2,2,
bar5_M = d + L     has orientations 2,1.
```

So neither `10_M` nor `bar5_M` is uniformly polarized as a whole SU(5)
multiplet.

The coherent split is instead:

```text
left doublets Q,L        uniform orientation 1,
right/conjugate sectors  uniform orientation 2.
```

For the conjugate branch, the same statement holds with orientations reversed.

# Pair Transport Check

For q79, all four ordinary SM Higgs pairs have the same finite transport:

```text
Q u, Q d, L e, L N  all carry 1+2 and are allowed.
```

For the conjugate branch, all carry:

```text
2+1.
```

Therefore the block route by itself does not generate an up/down finite
transport mismatch:

```text
up transport   = down transport,
Delta_t from block finite orientation alone = 0.
```

# Consequence

The monolithic tensor remains a valid conditional finite calculation.  It is
not invalidated.

But it is not sourced by the current block-factorized trivial-Higgs packet.
Those packets require a sector-resolved continuation:

```text
U_Q, U_u, U_d, U_L, U_e, U_N,
selected D_E,
selected dotD,
selected primitive C1 contractions.
```

The CKM heavy-link for the block route must come from sector-resolved
`C1/dotD/overlap` differences, not from importing:

```text
T_u = I_3, T_d = F
```

as a shortcut.

# Two Allowed Forward Routes

Route A is the high-scale SU(5)/E6 route:

```text
prove a selected source where 10_M and bar5_M are coherent whole multiplets,
include the nontrivial Higgs/projection data needed to avoid the trivial-Higgs
block obstruction,
then promote the conditional SU(5) tensor.
```

Route B is the block-factorized SM route:

```text
keep Q,L versus u,d,e,N conjugate orientations,
derive sector bases and dotD responses,
compute selected sector-resolved primitive C1 contractions.
```

# Guardrail

Until one of these routes is selected:

```text
do not claim the block route proves T_u=I_3, T_d=F,
do not discard the conditional tensor,
do not claim selected C1 values or full SM closure.
```
