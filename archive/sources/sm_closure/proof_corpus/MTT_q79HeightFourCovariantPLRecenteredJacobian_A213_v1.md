# MTT q79 Height-Four Covariant PL-Recentered Jacobian (A213) v1

This artifact computes the same-source central finite difference of

`F(A,m)=beta(A)-Pi(A)m`

using a moving selected beta branch, moving critical values, 86 moving thimble
columns, the moving marked fiber basis, and moving A/B handles.  The
`selected_039/selected_038` Picard-Lefschetz jump from A212 is applied before
the finite difference. It contains 8 of 8 real PGL3
directions.

The reconstructed beta is candidate-independent to maximum error
`0.000e+00`.

This is a floating derivative probe, not an interval Jacobian certificate or a
covariant zero proof. Every signed sample remains in the same post-A212 radial
and global-handle chamber.
