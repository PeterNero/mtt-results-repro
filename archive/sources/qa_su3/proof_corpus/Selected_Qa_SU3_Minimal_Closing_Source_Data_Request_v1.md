# Selected Qa/SU3 Minimal Closing Source Data Request v1

This is the exact closing packet now required by the proof program.

## Required

1. Source identity: selected branch, source certificate, and a selection rule not
   using observed constants or Qa/SU3 residuals.
2. Typed monad maps: global typed `f,g` entries, bases/cochains for charged
   entries, `g*f=0`, local-freeness, and stability/HYM.
3. Operator exit: same-source `D_E`, `rho_E`, or Cech/Dolbeault finite response.
4. Admissibility: Bianchi, Freed-Witten/gerbe if twisted, projector retention,
   trace normalization, representation, and zero-mode policy.

## Current Corpus Result

The current corpus does not fill this request.  The printed `A01` matrix is
rejected by the integrability audit, and no selected same-branch `D_E/rho_E`
matrix source is printed.

## Minimal Ways to Close

```text
A. corrected source-certified A01/D_E matrix + finite response
B. typed section/cochain bases and exact f,g with g*f=0, then D_E/rho_E
C. selected gerbe/twisted rho_E cocycle + finite determinant response
```

closure claimed: no
target fitting used: no
