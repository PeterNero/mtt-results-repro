# PostAlpha DynamicC1TransferTensor or GalerkinC1Values Import v1

## Result

Dynamic operator support and alpha1/dotD support are closed for the frontier.
The conditional dynamic tensor normal form is built but not selected.

```text
tensor name   = T_dynamic_conditional_WeylPair
codomain      = 72 real dimensions
rank          = 2
A^T A         = [[12, 0], [0, 12]]
A^T b         = [12, 12]
deltaTheta    = [1, 1]
```

The remaining value routes are now exactly: non-invariant primitive C1 tensor,
Hessian/source vector `b_selected`, or honest selected Galerkin C1 values.
