## Exact sheet-edge functor

Let `E_D` be the real rank-three sheet-permutation bundle. In the oriented
opposite-edge basis,

```text
Lambda^2 E_D = sign tensor E_D.
```

The determinant line of the permutation bundle is exactly `sign`. Therefore

```text
E_S := det(E_D) tensor Lambda^2 E_D is isomorphic to E_D.
```

This is the unordered opposite-edge strain bundle. The isomorphism is the
unique positive atom map

```text
C(d1,d2,d3)=(s23,s13,s12).
```

All six `S3` matrices are checked exactly. The determinant twist cancels the
orientation sign in every case. The determinant line is already identified by
the q79 SpinC theorem with the shared-Z64 sign line, independently of whether
the odd root is `chi_1` or `chi_33`.

## Shared root plane

The unique shared order-four subgroup and the two odd-root restrictions are

```text
C4=<16>={0,16,32,48},
chi_1(16m)=chi_33(16m)=i^m.
```

Realify this root character and tensor its real two-plane with `E_D`. Identify
the real copy with `E_D` and the imaginary copy with `E_S` through `C`.
Multiplication by `i` then induces

```text
J_DE(d,e)=(-C^{-1}e,Cd),
J_DE=[[0,-I3],[I3,0]].
```

This is exactly the previously certified lane quarter-turn, with no fitted
number or root choice. It commutes with every `S3` holonomy, hence is a global
parallel action on the minimal full-monodromy flat root-stack strain symbol.

## What this closes

The common-source functor is no longer merely an abstract equality of two
`2x2` matrices. On the flat sheet-symbol carrier it is the determinant-twisted
exterior-square functor tensored with the shared root plane. This gives a typed,
root-independent `C4` action whose generator is exactly `J_DE`.

## Why this is not yet HYM invariance

This construction acts on the finite sheet/Weyl symbol. It does not identify
that flat symbol connection with the nonzero-Chern inverse-Fourier-Mukai HYM
connection. Nor can the functor be replaced by direct conjugation on `Herm(3)`:
every unital unitary or antiunitary adjoint fixes the identity, whereas `J_DE`
sends the diagonal trace mode to the off-diagonal edge-sum mode. The earlier
square-theta direct-adjoint no-go is therefore an instance of a wider direct
algebra-action obstruction.

The remaining physical fork is exact:

```text
1. prove the actual inverse-Fourier-Mukai/HYM operator carries this outer
   twisted-exterior action and its Hessian is invariant;
2. prove C4 is autonomous Lens redundancy so the HYM operator descends;
3. compute the projected HYM block directly.
```
