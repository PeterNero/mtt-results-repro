# Selected Qa/SU3 Smooth Determinant Spectral Table or Source Operator v1

## What Closes

The finite projected Hessian determinant is now exact.

```text
H_sel spectrum = ['8', '18 - sqrt(73)', '18 + sqrt(73)']
det(H_sel) = 2008
finite-rank zeta logdet = log(2008)
```

This is the strongest determinant statement available from the current selected
finite Galerkin packet.

## Why This Still Is Not The Smooth Threshold Determinant

The smooth determinant has a complement-spectrum problem.  Two smooth
completions can share the same finite projection:

```text
Completion A logdet = log(2008)
Completion B logdet = log(2008) + log(Lambda)
```

The extra `Lambda` mode is invisible to the finite charge-coordinate block but
changes the determinant.  Therefore the selected finite Hessian does not
identify the full smooth Qa/SU3 threshold determinant.

## Corpus Scan Result

The fixed-point and Theta/Nil papers supply spectral-gap language, scalar
Nil-Laplacian formulas, and lower bounds.  They do not supply the selected
Qa/SU3 color-threshold spectrum, multiplicities, index weights, or smooth
operator finite part.

## Verdict

```text
finite projected determinant: closed
smooth threshold determinant: open
full Qa/SU3 closure: no
```
