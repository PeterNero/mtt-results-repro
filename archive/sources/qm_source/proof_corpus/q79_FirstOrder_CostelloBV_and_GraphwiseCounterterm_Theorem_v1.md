# q79 First-Order Costello BV and Graphwise Counterterm Theorem

Date: 2026-07-26

## 1. Result

The counterterm work package `CT` is closed on the declared
boundaryless, compact-support, auxiliary-Euclidean formal tier.

This required a real change of presentation. The ordinary second-order
Maxwell detour has a useful gauge-fixed Laplace-type Hessian, but it does
not supply the local first-order gauge-fixing operator required by
Costello's BV heat-renormalization theorem. Costello identifies the same
problem for ordinary Yang-Mills and uses a first-order auxiliary
formulation.

For each generator of
\[
\mathfrak g_{\rm SM}
=\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak u(1),
\]
we construct the first-order symbol complex
\[
1\longrightarrow 7\longrightarrow 7\longrightarrow 1.
\]
A positive weighted fiber metric gives a local differential
\(Q^{\rm GF}=Q^\dagger\) with
\[
(Q^{\rm GF})^2=0,
\qquad
[Q,Q^{\rm GF}]
=|\xi|_{g_E}^{2}I_{16}
\quad\text{at principal-symbol level}.
\]

The auxiliary self-dual two-form eliminates algebraically and recovers
the second-order q79 Yang-Mills action up to a topological term that is
constant on the declared fixed bundle sector. Higgs and doubled Weyl
summands already have local reverse operators with the same scalar
Laplace principal symbol.

Costello's graphwise recursion then emits local counterterms at every
finite perturbative bidegree. The existing exact q79 anomaly-zero result
makes every QME obstruction BRST exact modulo a total derivative, so
finite local primitive counterterms can be chosen order by order.

This does not compute numerical beta functions or matching constants.
It proves the existence and recursive source of the formal counterterm
series from the selected q79 action and heat propagator.

## 2. Why the first-order extension is necessary

Costello's gauge-fixing data consist of a local odd differential
operator \(Q^{\rm GF}\) of order at most one such that
\[
(Q^{\rm GF})^2=0
\]
and
\[
H=[Q,Q^{\rm GF}]
\]
is a generalized Laplacian.

The second-order Maxwell-detour differential contains arrow orders
\((1,2,1)\). Its adjoint Hodge sum is fourth order on the transverse
one-form rows. The preceding theorem therefore correctly excluded it
as the heat operator.

A pseudodifferential transverse-projector symbol can produce
\(|\xi|^2I\), but it is not a local differential \(Q^{\rm GF}\).
Consequently it cannot be used to invoke the local graphwise theorem.

The first-order Yang-Mills formulation repairs exactly this missing
hypothesis.

## 3. First-order gauge complex

On the auxiliary Euclidean four-manifold, let
\(\Omega^2_+\) denote self-dual two-forms. Per local gauge generator, use
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal B^0&=\Omega^0,\\
\mathcal B^1&=\Omega^1\oplus\Omega^2_+,\\
\mathcal B^2&=\Omega^2_+\oplus\Omega^3,\\
\mathcal B^3&=\Omega^4.
\end{aligned}
\tag{3.1}
\]

The fiber dimensions are
\[
(1,7,7,1).
\tag{3.2}
\]

At a nonzero Euclidean covector \(k\), the principal maps are
\[
\begin{aligned}
d_0(f)&=(k\wedge f,0),\\
d_1(a,b)&=(\pi_+(k\wedge a),-k\wedge b),\\
d_2(c,\eta)&=-k\wedge\eta.
\end{aligned}
\tag{3.3}
\]

Curvature commutators and the algebraic identity between the two
self-dual rows complete the full background differential. They are
lower order and do not alter (3.3). On an on-shell Yang-Mills
background, the full differential squares to zero.

For every \(k\ne0\), the exact ranks are
\[
\operatorname{rank}d_0=1,\qquad
\operatorname{rank}d_1=6,\qquad
\operatorname{rank}d_2=1.
\tag{3.4}
\]
Thus the symbol sequence is exact.

The certificate verifies (3.3)-(3.4) over the rationals at
\[
(1,0,0,0),\ (0,1,0,0),\ (0,0,1,0),\
(0,0,0,1),\ (1,2,3,4).
\]

## 4. Local weighted gauge fixing

Use the unnormalized self-dual basis
\[
e^{01}+e^{23},\qquad
e^{02}-e^{13},\qquad
e^{03}+e^{12}.
\tag{4.1}
\]

Give the \(\Omega^0\) and \(\Omega^1\) coordinates weight one, and give
both self-dual rows, \(\Omega^3\), and \(\Omega^4\) weight four. Let
\(G\) be this positive diagonal fiber metric and define
\[
Q^{\rm GF}=G^{-1}Q^T G.
\tag{4.2}
\]

The degree-reversing BV pairing \(J\) is the wedge/trace pairing between
\(\Omega^0\) and \(\Omega^4\), between \(\Omega^1\) and \(\Omega^3\),
and between the two self-dual rows. In the basis (4.1), the self-dual
pairing block is \(2I_3\). The exact calculation verifies
\[
\operatorname{rank}J=16,
\qquad
Q^T J+JQ=0,
\qquad
(Q^{\rm GF})^T J+JQ^{\rm GF}=0.
\tag{4.3}
\]
Thus the positive weighting is compatible with the odd BV pairing; it
is not merely a device for obtaining the desired scalar symbol.

Because every entry of \(Q\) is first order, (4.2) is a local
first-order differential operator. There is no factor
\(|k|^{-2}\) and no transverse pseudodifferential projector.

The exact matrix calculation gives
\[
Q^2=0,\qquad
(Q^{\rm GF})^2=0,
\tag{4.4}
\]
and
\[
QQ^{\rm GF}+Q^{\rm GF}Q
=|k|^2I_{16}.
\tag{4.5}
\]

The certificate also verifies the locality scaling
\[
\sigma(Q^{\rm GF})(2k)
=2\,\sigma(Q^{\rm GF})(k).
\tag{4.6}
\]

The faithful quotient
\[
(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1))/\mathbb Z_6
\]
has the same local Lie algebra. Therefore (3.1)-(4.6) repeat over
\(8+3+1=12\) generators without changing the proof.

## 5. Elimination of the auxiliary field

For each gauge factor \(a\), introduce
\(B_a\in\Omega^2_+(\operatorname{ad}P_a)\) and use
\[
S_{\rm FO,a}
=\frac{1}{g_a^2}
\int\left(
2\langle B_a,F_a^+\rangle
-\langle B_a,B_a\rangle
\right).
\tag{5.1}
\]

The \(B_a\) equation is algebraic:
\[
B_a=F_a^+.
\tag{5.2}
\]

Substitution gives
\[
S_{\rm FO,a}^{\rm red}
=\frac{1}{g_a^2}\int\|F_a^+\|^2.
\tag{5.3}
\]

In four Euclidean dimensions,
\[
\|F^+\|^2
=\frac12\left(
\|F\|^2+\langle F,*F\rangle
\right).
\tag{5.4}
\]
Hence (5.3) equals the second-order Yang-Mills action plus a multiple
of \(\int\operatorname{tr}(F\wedge F)\).

For compact perturbations in one fixed bundle sector, that difference
is constant. The two presentations have the same local equations,
Hessian, interaction expansion, and perturbative observables.

This theorem does not assert equality after summing inequivalent
topological sectors. The \(B_a\) field is an algebraically eliminable
auxiliary field, not a new particle. Equation (5.1) uses the existing
gauge couplings and adds no parameter.

## 6. Higgs and Weyl summands

The full auxiliary-Euclidean BV complex is the direct sum of:

1. the first-order gauge complex (3.1);
2. the Higgs shifted-cotangent two-term complex;
3. the doubled Weyl shifted-cotangent complex.

For the Higgs block, the reverse map is order zero and
\[
[Q_H,Q_H^{\rm GF}]=P_H,
\]
where \(P_H\) is generalized Laplace type.

For the doubled Weyl block, the reverse map is the adjoint Weyl
operator and
\[
[Q_W,Q_W^{\rm GF}]
=D^-D^+\oplus D^+D^-.
\]

The existing certificate proves that these squares have
\(|\xi|^2I\) principal symbol. Background curvature, masses, Higgs
profiles, and Yukawa maps are lower order.

All quadratic terms are placed in \(Q\). The remaining gauge, Higgs
quartic, and four Yukawa channels are local interactions at least cubic
in fluctuations. Their classical master equation is already certified.

The Lorentzian antighost/Nakanishi pair is contractible. It can be
removed before this minimal Euclidean construction without changing
BRST cohomology.

## 7. Graphwise counterterm recursion

Let
\[
P(\epsilon,T)
=\int_\epsilon^T
(Q^{\rm GF}\otimes1)K_t\,dt
\tag{7.1}
\]
be the heat propagator of (4.4) and the matter summands.

The preceding `HK` theorem supplies the local graph-weight asymptotics
on compact interaction support. Fix a renormalization splitting
\[
\mathcal A
=\mathcal A_{\geq0}\oplus\mathcal A_{<0},
\tag{7.2}
\]
and write \(\operatorname{Sing}_{<0}\) for projection onto the singular
summand.

At graph bidegree \((i,k)\), define recursively
\[
C_{i,k}(\epsilon)
=\operatorname{Sing}_{<0}
\Gamma_{i,k}\left(
P(\epsilon,T),
I-\sum_{(j,l)<(i,k)}
\hbar^j C_{j,l}(\epsilon)
\right).
\tag{7.3}
\]

Costello's counterterm theorem gives:

- \(C_{i,k}\) is a local functional;
- it is independent of the positive heat scale \(T\);
- subtraction by (7.3) has a finite \(\epsilon\to0\) limit;
- the resulting effective actions satisfy the exact RG semigroup law;
- for a fixed splitting (7.2), the counterterm series is unique.

At every finite perturbative truncation, only finitely many preceding
bidegrees enter. The formal theory is their inverse limit.

The certificate checks the singular projection and subtraction exactly
on a rational Laurent row and checks a finite bidegree dependency
table. Those finite rows are structural witnesses; the all-bidegree
claim comes from the registered graph-asymptotic and counterterm
theorems applied to the q79 data above.

## 8. BRST primitive induction

Suppose the renormalized QME has been solved below order \(n\). Its
order-\(n\) breaking \(\mathcal O_n\) is local and obeys
\[
s\mathcal O_n=0\pmod d
\tag{8.1}
\]
by the Wess-Zumino consistency condition.

The possible nontrivial class lies in
\[
H_{\rm local}^{1,4}(s\mid d).
\tag{8.2}
\]

For the selected q79 three-family carrier, the complete coefficient
vector is exactly
\[
(0,0,0,0,0).
\tag{8.3}
\]

Therefore
\[
\mathcal O_n=sB_n+dC_n
\tag{8.4}
\]
for local functionals \(B_n,C_n\). Adding
\[
-\hbar^n B_n
\tag{8.5}
\]
removes the breaking. Adler-Bardeen then supplies a compatible
all-orders formal scheme from the exact one-loop cancellation.

Equations (8.1)-(8.5) are coefficientwise at every finite order. They
prove primitive existence and the QME-compatible counterterm
induction. They do not select numerical beta functions or finite
matching constants.

Different representatives \(B_n\) are finite-renormalization
conventions connected by the Stueckelberg-Petermann group. They are
not additional physical knobs.

## 9. Support and boundary

All vertices are supported in
\[
K=\operatorname{supp}I\Subset X.
\]
The graphwise counterterms are local and supported on the vertex
diagonals in \(K\). Their trace on the auxiliary boundary therefore
vanishes.

The `HK` theorem proves that changing the auxiliary boundary
realization changes the kernel on \(K\) by \(O(t^\infty)\). Thus no
boundary coefficient enters the local UV counterterms on this domain.

This does not prove finite-scale independence or cover a physical
boundary.

## 10. Corrected bridge

The Euclidean graphwise `CT` construction has no causal cones or Cauchy
surfaces. Therefore an "equicausal Cauchy theorem for the Euclidean
heat prescription" is not a well-typed `CT` requirement.

The remaining bridge is one package:

```text
EL =
  Euclidean-to-Lorentzian local comparison
  + identification with the selected EG prescription
  + renormalized equicausal Cauchy transport.
```

The already closed Lorentzian free equicausal time-slice theorem is
preserved. It is not yet promoted to the Euclidean effective action.

Stueckelberg-Petermann freedom compares prescriptions after they are in
one perturbative causal framework. It is not itself a Wick-rotation
theorem.

## 11. Theorem

**Theorem.** On every declared smooth on-shell q79 chart, for compactly
supported local interactions and one fixed gauge-bundle topological
sector:

1. the gauge sector has a first-order local BV extension with fiber
   dimensions \(1,7,7,1\) per gauge generator;
2. its positive weighted adjoint \(Q^{\rm GF}\) is local, first order,
   square zero, and satisfies
   \([Q,Q^{\rm GF}]=|\xi|^2I\) at principal-symbol level;
3. algebraic elimination recovers the second-order q79 Yang-Mills
   sector up to a fixed-sector topological constant;
4. the Higgs and doubled Weyl summands satisfy the same generalized
   Laplace hypothesis;
5. Costello's recursion constructs local, heat-scale-independent
   counterterms at every finite graph bidegree;
6. the exact zero anomaly class makes all QME breakings removable by
   local BRST primitives in a compatible all-orders formal scheme;
7. local UV counterterms have zero auxiliary-boundary trace.

Consequently,

```text
B.QFT.02_firstorder_local_Costello_BV_presentation
  = closed_on_fixed_sector_auxiliary_Euclidean_formal_tier;

B.QFT.02_CT_graphwise_local_counterterms
  = closed_at_every_finite_perturbative_bidegree;

B.QFT.02_CT_QME_BRST_primitives
  = closed_by_zero_local_anomaly_class_and_all_orders_compatible_scheme;

B.QFT.02_spectral_or_heat_to_EG_counterterm_bridge
  = open_one_independent_work_package_EL.
```

`B.QFT.02` overall remains open.

## 12. Claim boundary

Not proved here:

- a Euclidean-to-Lorentzian comparison;
- equality with the selected Lorentzian Epstein-Glaser prescription;
- renormalized equicausal Cauchy transport;
- numerical beta functions, thresholds, or scheme matching;
- equivalence after summing topological sectors;
- convergence at fixed nonzero coupling;
- nonperturbative completion.
