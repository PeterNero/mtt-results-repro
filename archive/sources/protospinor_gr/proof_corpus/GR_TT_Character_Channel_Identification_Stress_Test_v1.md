# GR TT Character-Channel Identification Stress Test v1

## Result

The selected character-channel covariance import survives the stress test as
shared internal scale data, but it should not be overstated as a literal
subspace identity.

Closed common infrastructure:

```text
exact Z64 branch selected q_64 = 15
GR TT support = |d_*> tensor span{c2,s2}
GR TT lambda  = 15
covariance selected channel = E_15 K_64
d_Q = 1.0
rho_UV = 0.164530397543639
s_star = 1.464646774701829
```

## Critical Distinction

The covariance closure lives on:

```text
E_15 K_64
```

The GR TT response support lives on:

```text
|d_*> tensor span{c_2,s_2}
```

These share the exact central-circle/Z64/q64 infrastructure, but they are not
literally the same representation slot. `E_15` is the selected CP character
line; `span{c_2,s_2}` is the real helicity-2 TT response plane.
In short, they are not literally the same subspace.

## What We May Claim

We may use the imported `rho_UV` and `s_star` as shared selected internal scale
data in the GR physical-normalization chain.

## What Remains Open

A stronger theorem would have to prove:

```text
The stochastic unresolved disturbance feeding the GR TT response is the same selected CP character channel E_15 K_64, not merely a response operator supported on the helicity-2 TT plane.
```

Until then, the principal physical gate remains:

```text
Omega_0
```
