# MTT q79 Height-Four d071 Affine-Chain Basis Reanchor (A380AB) v1

The smooth fiber is the affine genus-two curve `u^2=P_6(t)` with its two
points over infinity removed.  Its integral first homology has rank five, not
four: compact `H_1` contributes four coordinates and the puncture exact
sequence contributes one.  The five lifted adjacent branch arcs in projected
order `[3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 5]` form the integral affine `A5` chain basis.  Its antisymmetric
intersection matrix has rank four and radical generator `(1,0,1,0,1)`.

Arb recomputes all five direct period columns and solves the real rows
`[0, 1, 5, 6, 9]` against the independently transported terminal affine
source.  The five coefficient intervals each isolate one and only one integer,
giving

```
[0, 0, -1, -1, 0]
```

in the oriented direct-cut basis.  This supplies the puncture coordinate that
compact `Sp(4,Z)` monodromy cannot see.  Re-evaluating that exact integral
cycle reduces the five-period lift radius from `4.2578492759324226e-07` to
`1.8708665102787875e-39`, a factor `2.2758701663316099e+32`.
No observed Standard Model value enters the selection.

This closes the smooth-base affine source and reanchor.  It does not by itself
close the subsequent 72-row Hessian transport or the final interval-Newton
chart.
