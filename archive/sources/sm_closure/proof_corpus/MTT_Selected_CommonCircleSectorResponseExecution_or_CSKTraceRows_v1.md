# MTT Selected CommonCircleSectorResponseExecution or CSKTraceRows v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_COMMONCIRCLESECTORRESPONSEEXECUTION_OR_CSKTRACEROWS_HCEN_AND_TRACE_ENGINE_CLOSED_PHI_VALUES_OPEN`

## Theorem

`CommonCircleSectorResponseExecutionTheorem` is proved.

The selected q79/F,m=1 Weyl/gerbe source emits a finite source-level common
circle operator:

`H_cen = diag(1, zeta_3, zeta_3^2)`.

The sector projectors `P_u,P_d,P_e` and the dual family trace rows
`B_0,B_1,B_2` are constructed.  The Vandermonde-dual residual is
`2.7755575615628914e-16`.

Therefore the nine rows

`Tr_N(P_s * B_k * H_cen * Phi_sector_N)`

are formally executable.

## Boundary

The trace engine is closed, but strict numerical `c_{s,k}` closure is not.
`Phi_sector_N` numerical values have not yet been emitted by the selected
source.  Existing policy values are retained only as comparison/replay rows and
are not accepted as no-knob source data.

## Counts

- formal trace rows executed: `9`
- accepted strict `c_{s,k}` source rows: `0`
- `H_cen` source-level emitted: `True`
- `Phi_sector_N` numeric values emitted: `false`
