# MTT Selected Residual WeylPolynomial Source Theorem Attempt v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_RESIDUAL_WEYLPOLYNOMIAL_SOURCE_THEOREM_ATTEMPT_BUILT_PROJECTOR_SELECTION_OPEN`.

The residual matrices are now exactly compressed into qutrit Weyl polynomials:

```text
R_X = (1/3) I + (1/3) X - (2/3) X^2
R_Z = (2/3) I + (2/3) Z - (1/3) X - (1/3) X^2 + (e^{i*pi/3}/3) Z X + (e^{-i*pi/3}/3) Z X^2
```

This is progress because the missing Lane A object is no longer an arbitrary
matrix packet.  It is a canonical Weyl-polynomial residual packet over the
already selected source-level `Z/X` carrier, active shift `(1,1)`, fixed-fiber
class `[0,1,2]`, and trace/Frobenius normalization.

What remains open is the selection theorem saying that `Phi_fin^C1`, the
basis-transport correction, or the Hessian counterterm applies the canonical
trace-orthogonal residual projector as the physical dynamic response.  Without
that theorem, the packet remains diagnostic and SM-parity dynamic closure is not
claimed.

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target
residuals are used as selectors.
