# PostAlpha End0 Sector ModelValues Import v1

## Result

The End0-to-sector frontier now has canonical model values:

```text
domain basis = T1,T2,T3
matter sectors = Q,u,d,L,e,N
matter rank = 6*3
H rank = 1
total sector carrier rank = 19
```

All projector and bracket checks pass at the model level. The old `B1,B2,B3`
SM support dictionary is compatible with this sector carrier:

```text
Q -> B3+B2+B1
u,d -> B3+B1
L -> B2+B1
e -> B1
N -> sterile/none
H -> B2+B1 support reuse
```

This is still not a physical `dotD_alpha1` payload. The selected zero-mode
bases `K_s`, selected source map `rho_s`, matter-slot routing, `1_M` rule, and
transfer normalization remain open.

Status:

```text
POST_ALPHA_END0_SECTOR_MODEL_VALUES_CONSTRUCTED_SELECTED_ZEROMODES_OPEN
