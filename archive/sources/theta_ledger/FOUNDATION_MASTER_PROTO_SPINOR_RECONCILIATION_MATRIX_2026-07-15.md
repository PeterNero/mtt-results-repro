## Controlling Results

This pass uses the following results as its controlling boundary.

1. A world-in-world comparison field is a section
   `Q_WW in Gamma(Hom(TP,TI))` between rank-three bundles.  Locally it is a
   `3 x 3` matrix with nine components.  The total space of an ordinary
   rank-three bundle over a three-dimensional base is six-dimensional, not
   nine-dimensional.
2. At a nonsingular comparison background, the local linear decomposition is
   `Mat(3,R) = so(3) + Sym(3,R)`.  The symmetric part splits orthogonally as
   scalar trace, traceless diagonal, and symmetric off-diagonal sectors of
   dimensions `1 + 2 + 3`.  Hence `1 + 3 x 3 = (1 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3)` is a
   component identity.  It is not a derivation of a ten-dimensional manifold
   or of `3+1` Lorentzian spacetime.
3. In the selected q79 degree-three carrier, `A = pi_* O_C` has trace split
   `A = O + A0` with ranks `1 + 2`.  The common carrier
   `L_shared tensor (O + A0 + A)` has rank `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
4. The q79 signed sheet representation has local binary-dihedral spin lift
   `Dic_3`.  A strict global Spin lift remains conditional on the central signs
   of all branch-complement relators, equivalently the relevant obstruction
   class.  A shared-circle SpinC cancellation is not the same as a strict Spin
   lift.
5. The shared circle is common `U(1)` phase or holonomy data and is counted
   once.  Physical time is a noncompact ordering variable supplied by the
   Lorentzian completion; it is not identified with the compact phase circle.
6. The q79 Fu-Yau branch is the current selected global compactification
   candidate.  `L(3,1) x Nil3` is an auxiliary/effective model.  Literal
   `S1 x Lens x Nil`, literal manifold nesting, and equality of the two global
   topologies are not proof sources.

## Paper Dispositions

| Paper | Valid core retained | Required correction | New status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation v7 | Hilbert-bundle spine, projector, fixed-point, descent, and physical-completion gates | Add the local comparison carrier, distinguish component counts from manifold dimensions, type the q79 rank carrier, and state the missing intertwiner | Core foundation with an explicit geometry interface |
| Projection-Admissibility v2 | Typed descent, sections, decoders, and recovery | No new geometry-dependent claim found | Re-audited; unchanged |
| Baseline Scales v2 | Separation of internal, physical, curvature, and RG scales | No new geometry-dependent claim found | Re-audited; unchanged |
| Signature Stability v2 | Principal-symbol Lorentzian compatibility | State explicitly that the `1 + 3 x 3` count does not select dimension or signature | Conditional physical-completion theorem |
| Coherent Kinematics v2 | Chart-relative trajectories and physical bridge | Separate compact phase holonomy from noncompact physical time | Conditional encoding/kinematics theorem |
| Typed Relationship Atlas v3 | Typed cross-framework relations and containment standard | Add q79 trace-split carrier, local `Dic_3` status, auxiliary Lens-Nil status, and same-source intertwiner obligation | Updated relationship atlas |
| Proto-Spinor v4 | Conditional double-cover mechanism and carrier dictionary | Withdraw universal dimensional minimality, forced Spin(3), and exhaustive CLN claims; add q79 local/global distinction | Conditional spinorial closure and q79 interface |
| World-in-World v4 | Rank-three comparison field and local polar decomposition | Replace dimensional multiplication and automatic emergence of time/gravity/matter/quantization by a staged globalization program | Local comparison geometry and research program |
| Closure Strain v5 | `Sym(3)` normal form and its `1+2+3` split | Withdraw automatic family, Higgs, charge, confinement, and SM derivations; type these as conditional encodings/source obligations | Local normal forms and conditional matter encodings |
| Proto-Spinor/Worldsheet v3 | Quadratic local matching templates | Supply an explicit typed bridge, domain, remainder, and worldsheet consistency obligations | Conditional local bridge |
| Ten-Dimensional Action v3 | A useful candidate EFT template | Retitle as an ansatz; identify imported metric/action data, omitted operators, pole-mass condition, truncation equations, and q79 geometry status | Regime-local ten-dimensional action ansatz |

## Shared Frontier

The papers must not hide the common missing theorem behind different names.
The decisive geometry theorem is a same-source intertwiner from the local
world-in-world/strain filtration to the selected q79 vertical carrier and its
connection:

`I_WW->q79 : Sym(T*P tensor TI) -> L_shared tensor (O + A0 + A)`.

It must preserve the `1+2+3` sectors, metrics, covariant derivatives, and the
operators used by the numerical source packets.  Separately, strict q79 Spin
globalization requires the branch-relator sign calculation.  Neither theorem
is replaced by equality of ranks.
