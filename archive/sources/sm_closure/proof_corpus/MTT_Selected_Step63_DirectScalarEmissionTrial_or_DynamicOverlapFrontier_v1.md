## Active Frontier

The direct numerical row route has been tried against the closed source/domain,
same-branch readiness, transported Phi_fin support, and static matter-slot
readout. It still emits zero accepted rows. The remaining blocker is dynamic,
not static:

`MTT_Selected_TypedBN_RetardedDerivative_or_PrimitiveResponse_ValueEmission_v1`

Minimum next success: emit a typed same-branch `B_N` retarded derivative/alpha1
driver and End0-to-sector functor values, or emit selected primitive/vertex/
basis-transport response values with `b_selected`.
