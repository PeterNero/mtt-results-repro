title: "Visible Active F3 Image Recovery: Naive Coordinate Route Obstruction"

abstract: |
  The visible complex-worldvolume spinC gate closes W3 for the D7 divisors
  S1,S2,S3 and matter curves Cij named in the CY-corner execution corpus.  The
  remaining Freed-Witten object is the active F3^2 image of those
  worldvolumes.  This note tests the literal factorized-coordinate
  interpretation of the execution papers and proves that it cannot be the
  complete selected packet: if the two independent active qutrit generators are
  tangent coordinate directions, at least one coordinate divisor always has
  rank-two active image, hence nonzero DD(B) under the m=1 gate.  The result is
  not a no-go for all geometry; it rules out the naive coordinate-divisor fill
  and sharpens the next required construction.

# Purpose

We have closed:

```text
W3/spinC for the visible complex-worldvolume class.
```

What remains is:

```text
active F3^2 images for S1,S2,S3,Cij,
DD(B)|Y = 0 for each selected visible worldvolume.
```

This note asks whether those images are already forced by the simple
factorized CY corner in the execution corpus.

# Factorized Coordinate Model

The execution papers use a three-modulus factorized corner with:

```text
X6 = T1 x T2 x T3,
kappa_123 = 1,
S1 = T2 x T3,
S2 = T1 x T3,
S3 = T1 x T2,
C12 = T3,
C23 = T1,
C31 = T2.
```

The m=1 gerbe/Freed-Witten gate says that a selected worldvolume passes the
finite DD(B) test exactly when its active image in the rank-two symplectic
quotient F3^2 has rank at most one.

# Enumeration

We enumerate all coordinate-tangent placements of the two independent active
generators:

```text
e1 -> one of T1,T2,T3,
e2 -> one of T1,T2,T3.
```

There are nine assignments.  In every assignment, at least one of S1,S2,S3 sees
both e1 and e2, hence has rank-two active image.

The reason is elementary:

```text
If e1,e2 lie in the same factor Tk,
then any divisor not excluding Tk contains both.

If e1,e2 lie in distinct factors Ti,Tj,
then the remaining divisor S_k contains both.
```

Thus the literal coordinate-divisor packet cannot satisfy the m=1 DD(B) rule
for all three D7 stacks.

# What This Means

This does not say that the protospinor, qutrit, or CY-corner corpus is wrong.
It says the complete visible brane packet cannot be filled by the naive move:

```text
"take S1,S2,S3 as coordinate D7 divisors and put the full active F3^2 plane
tangent to the factorized corner."
```

The correct next route must supply one of the following:

```text
1. a selected non-coordinate or isotropic active-image map where each visible
   worldvolume sees rank <= 1;
2. a selected B-field placement whose pullback to visible divisors is trivial
   or line-isotropic;
3. an explicit twisted Chan-Paton / worldvolume-flux cancellation certificate
   extending the current zero-DD validator;
4. a dual heterotic/line-bundle packet replacing the D7 coordinate-divisor
   interpretation.
```

# Guardrail

This note does not close Freed-Witten for the visible packet.  It closes only a
false shortcut: the naive coordinate divisor active-image route.
