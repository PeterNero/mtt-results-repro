## dotD_alpha1, Riesz/Green Response, and C1 Overlap Tensor

Target paper: `C:\ObsidianVault\BrainOfNerodes\Papers\Modal Triplet Theory\18 Theta-Closure & Execution Program\Theta_Closure_in_Modal_Triplet_Theory_II__Direct_Geometric_Realization_of_Nonabelian_Overlaps.md`

Status: `APPENDIX_DRAFT_PROOF_SLOT_OPEN`

Proof label: **Theorem slot I5**

Purpose: convert a current selected-source caveat into an explicit theorem slot. This section does not promote any lifted diagnostic flag.

Statement to add:

> The alpha1 deformation differentiates the selected D_E within the same branch and same B_N basis, producing horizontal responses, Riesz/Green inverses, and finite C1 overlap tensors used for the Route-C response.

Current blockers closed if and only if the statement is proved:
- `dotD_alpha1_in_same_basis`
- `selected_dotD_source_verified`
- `alpha1_driver_verified`
- `R5_selected_C1_response`

Proof obligations:
- Define alpha1 as a same-branch deformation of the selected source.
- Compute dotD_alpha1 matrices in the emitted B_N basis.
- Prove horizontal gauge and reduced Green equations.
- Emit primitive C1 overlap contractions and Hessian/source blocks.
- Prove no benchmark masses, CKM/PMNS, or observed constants enter selection.

Dependencies inside the selected-source appendix chain:
- `I4_selected_DE_action_and_source_flags`

Executable or corpus artifacts to cite while proving this section:
- `candidate_data/selected_source_origin_and_alpha1_driver.candidate.json`
- `candidate_data/selected_phifin_alpha1_payload.candidate.json`

Safe wording before proof:

> dotD and C1 response should not be promoted until alpha1_driver_verified and selected_dotD_source_verified are theorem-derived.

Required guardrail sentence:

> No observed masses, mixings, thresholds, or fitted constants are used to select the source, branch, cover, operator, or promotion flag in this section.

Cross-repo consistency note:
- `mtt-q79-proof-repro`: Algebraic validator success under lifted flags is a diagnostic, not selected-source proof. Evidence: Iwasawa Route-C branch smoke attempt reports Route-C, D_E, and Riesz/Green failing only because selected_source_verified is false.
- `mtt-nonsm-constants-no-knob`: The same theorem-derived flag policy must govern constants outside the SM packet as well. Evidence: Finite selected-connection source attempts reject packets whose downstream algebra works only after selected flags are lifted.
