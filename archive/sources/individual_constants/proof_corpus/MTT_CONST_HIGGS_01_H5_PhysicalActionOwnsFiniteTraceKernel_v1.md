new Higgs-specific parameters                    0
```

## Theorem

H5 attacks the physical-action ownership lemma directly.  The result is a
guardrail theorem:

```text
closed finite trace support
+ exact Weyl rows
+ formal 110-row replay
+ boundary algebra
does not imply physical Phi_fin^C1 action ownership.
```

The imported countermodel blocks the shortcut.  This is exactly the right
place to be strict: row values and support are not source ownership.

## Remaining Kernel

The remaining theorem is:

```text
SelectedPhiFinC1PreResidualActionKernelTheorem
```

It must prove that the selected physical differentiated `Phi_fin^C1` action
is the least-defect trace/Frobenius source functional emitting `R_Z`, `R_X`,
and `b_selected`, with zero extra boundary/source term.

## Higgs Consequence

The Higgs quartic is still blocked by two objects:

```text
1. PhysicalActionOwnsFiniteTraceKernel
2. SelectedHiggsNonlinearAmplitudeProjection
```

H5 attacks object 1 and reduces it to the pre-residual action-kernel theorem.
Object 2 remains the parallel `H5B` projection contract.
