# Selected SU2 Sphere Gauge Block Equivalence v1

## Purpose

This note attempts the SU2 analogue of the closed Qc circle lemma.

The result is a reduction, not closure.

## Exact Data

The exact scalar-proxy sphere zeta determinant is:

```text
p_SU2 = -4 zeta_R'(-1) + (2/3) log((f2 R_lens)^2)
       = -0.5980970589159109.
```

With the current Casimir heat-coefficient candidate:

```text
C_A(SU2)=2,
p_SU2 -> -1.1961941178318218.
```

## Why Qc Closed But SU2 Does Not Yet

For Qc, the abelian Faddeev-Popov determinant is field-independent and
decouples.  Therefore it cannot contribute a selected field-dependent
weak-split threshold.

For SU2, the gauge-fixing source gives the non-abelian Faddeev-Popov operator:

```text
M_G[A] = partial^mu D_mu[A].
```

This depends on the gauge field.  Consequently the ghost/quotient determinant
can carry a finite threshold contribution.  It cannot be discarded by the same
argument used for Qc.

## Negative Check

The already audited formal de Rham vector/ghost check gives:

```text
lambda_12 = -1.221170291645661.
```

That branch is explicitly not selected.  So the SU2 closure cannot be obtained
by importing the naive de Rham vector/ghost determinant on the scalar proxy
geometry.

## Conditional Equivalence

The SU2 sphere scalar zeta would become the selected weak-split gauge block if
one proves:

```text
the non-abelian quotient/ghost determinant contributes no additional finite
weak-split term beyond the C_A(SU2)=2 heat coefficient.
```

That statement is not in the current corpus.

## Missing For Closure

The next theorem must supply:

```text
1. selected SU2 connection and curvature endomorphism,
2. selected non-abelian Faddeev-Popov ghost operator in the physical quotient,
3. BRST-compatible determinant sign/subtraction rule,
4. proof that the finite quotient determinant is zero, universal, or exactly
   included in the C_A(SU2)=2 heat coefficient.
```

## Verdict

The exact scalar sphere piece is retained.

The SU2 gauge-block equivalence is not closed.
