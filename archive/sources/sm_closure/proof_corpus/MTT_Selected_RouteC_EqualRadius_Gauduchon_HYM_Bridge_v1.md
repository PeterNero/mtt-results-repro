# MTT Selected Route-C Equal-Radius Gauduchon HYM Bridge v1

## Claim

The old target-wall requirement was too strong after the terminal-section
ordered source selected `L=(1,-2,0)`.  Equal radius cannot select the branch by
itself, but it can serve as the selected Gauduchon metric once the branch is
selected elsewhere.

## Calculation

At equal radius the slope vector is `p=(1,1,1)`, so
`mu(L)=1-2=-1<0`.  In the reduced AH section algebra:

- `Hom(M,L)` has no nonnegative-slope candidates.
- `Hom(M,L^{-1})` has exactly `(-2,2,0)`, `(-1,1,0)`, and `(-1,2,0)`.
- These three candidates are a subset of the six candidates already killed by
  the injective Yoneda boundaries.

Therefore the selected ordered AH/Cech `V_alpha` layer is stable at the selected
equal-radius Gauduchon metric.

## HYM Bridge

With the selected AH/Cech source layer, the rank-one reflexive-hull reduction,
and the selected equal-radius Gauduchon metric, the Li-Yau/Gauduchon bridge
gives abstract HYM existence for the selected holomorphic bundle and metric.

This still does not emit HYM operator values, `D_E`, Riesz/Green, `dotD`, C1
primitive contractions, or full SM closure.

## Superset Status

This is a combined superset path with a locked target.  The terminal-section
source selects the branch; the constants/rho_UV program supplies the selected
equal-horizontal metric; the AH/Yoneda proof supplies the stability calculation.
Equal radius is not used as a branch selector.
