# GEO.01 Explicit Cech Connection Compiler

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Result:** the post-endpoint symbol step is deterministic

## Advance

The preceding theorem established that supplied HYM connections admit exact
finite projective-module symbols. This pass turns that existence statement
into a source-hashable compiler.

Given endpoint transition matrices, Hermitian metrics, a finite good cover,
a normalized partition and local physical connection forms, it emits

```text
p_ij = chi_i chi_j u_ij
```

and

```text
A0 = U* dU
Delta = A-A0
Gamma = U Delta U*
D_p = p d + Gamma.
```

The exact identity

```text
D_p U = U(d+A)
```

preserves curvature, HYM, coupled differentials and Hessians.

## Important Correction

The projector by itself carries the partition-induced Grassmann connection,
not generally the physical HYM connection. The physical symbol is therefore

```text
(p_Q, Gamma_Q),
```

not `p_Q` alone.

## Hidden Twist

The order-three hidden fundamental carrier remains twisted. Its scalar
triple-overlap phase cancels under conjugation, so

```text
ad(E_h^tau)=End_0(E_h^tau)
```

has an honest rank-80 Cech cocycle. The exact qutrit witness checks 729
adjoint composition rows with zero failures, despite 36 fundamental products
having nonzero central phase.

## Rank-102 Output

The compiler applies blockwise to

```text
T*X + ad(TX) + ad(E_v) + ad(E_h^tau) + TX
```

with ranks

```text
3 + 8 + 8 + 80 + 3 = 102.
```

Atiyah and anomaly maps transport blockwise. No additional symbol selector is
needed after the endpoint and tangent-connection source rows.

## Finite-Cutoff Result

Two projector presentations of the same connection are related by a partial
unitary. Their finite residuals agree only when the physical finite subspace
is transported with that partial unitary.

The exact shared-circle witness shows that a fixed raw ambient Fourier window
can lose `16/25` of a boundary mode after a harmless presentation change.
That loss is not physics. It proves that the remaining `QHP` calculation must
start from an intrinsic finite subspace.

## Frontier

```text
explicit Cech/connection compiler:      12/12
physical q79 instantiation:              0/3
post-endpoint symbol selectors:            0
B.GEO.01 overall:                       OPEN
```

The second physical row is now deterministic after `B.HS.01`; it is not an
additional source problem. The remaining independent exit is the endpoint
source plus intrinsic finite-subspace identification and one
`QHP`/Feshbach execution.

No physical parameter, fit or observed value was introduced.
