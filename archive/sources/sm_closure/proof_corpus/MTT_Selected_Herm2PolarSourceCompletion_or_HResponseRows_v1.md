# MTT Selected Herm(2) Polar Source Completion or H-Response Rows v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_HERM2POLARSOURCECOMPLETION_OR_HRESPONSEROWS_TRACEFREE_CONTRACT_CLOSED_PHASE_TRACE_ROWS_OPEN`

## Theorem

The trace-free Herm(2) polar contract is closed for the non-scalar Higgs block:

```text
M_H^tf = [[Delta, Omega], [conj(Omega), -Delta]]
Delta  = sigma_D * r_H * sqrt(s_beta)
Omega  = r_H * sqrt(1-s_beta) * exp(i phi_Omega)
```

Here `s_beta = 0.004701083905943647`, so `sqrt(s_beta) = 0.068564450744855` and
`sqrt(1-s_beta) = 0.9976466890107221`.

## Boundary

`m0` is retired only for the trace-free threshold block.  It is not retired for
full `Huu/Hdd` response rows, spectrum, or logdet unless a quotient trace-free
H-response theorem is emitted.

Static/dynamic matter-orientation packets were rechecked and are not legal
sources for the Higgs `Omega` phase.

Accepted H-response source rows: `0`.
