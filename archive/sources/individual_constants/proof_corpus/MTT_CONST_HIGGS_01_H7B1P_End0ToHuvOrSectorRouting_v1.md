## What Moved Forward

This is not a loop over H7B1O.  H7B1P imports newer QA/SU3 progress: model
End0-to-sector values, functional HYM projectors and `rho_s`, symbolic transport
projector/Riesz/Green replay, and the differentiated transport/dotD formula.
The 1_M Dirac-neutrino rule also has seven-of-seven structural support.

## Remaining Boundary

For Higgs, this route reaches only the collapsed rank-one `H` singlet.  It does
not emit the UV two-Higgs basis `(H_u,H_d^dagger)`, `B_Huv`, `M_source`, or
direct `Huu,Hud,Hdd` rows.

The next exact gate is:

`CONST-HIGGS-01 / HIGGS-QUARTIC-THRESHOLD / H7B1Q-TWOHIGGS-LIFT-OR-SAMESOURCE-FUNCTIONAL-VALUE`
