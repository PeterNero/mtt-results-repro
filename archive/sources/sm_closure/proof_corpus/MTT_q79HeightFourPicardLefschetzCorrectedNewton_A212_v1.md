# MTT q79 Height-Four Picard-Lefschetz-Corrected Newton (A212) v1

The selected rank-3 Newton path crosses the `selected_039` radial carrier with
`selected_038` at scale `0.540488068759`.  The
floating wall bracket has width
`2.980e-09`.

The selected vanishing cycles are `v64=[1, 0, 0, -1]` and
`v65=[1, 1, 0, 0]`.  With the selected intersection matrix and convention
`T_v=I-v*v^T*J`, their intersection is exactly `1`.  The continued
period is therefore

`P64_continued = P64_raw + P65`.

The period data select this integer coefficient independently at scales 0.55
and 0.75.  The weaker of the two best-versus-next-best separation factors is
`2.889e+03`.

After applying the jump to the complete candidate chain, the full rank-3 step
has residual L2 norm
`0.00590215820625`
instead of the raw discontinuous value
`6.09597003689`.  The
Jacobian predicted
`0.00589842249124`.

This establishes the floating chamber-aware continuation rule and rescues the
full Newton step.  It is not yet an interval wall/jump certificate and it does
not prove a covariant zero.
