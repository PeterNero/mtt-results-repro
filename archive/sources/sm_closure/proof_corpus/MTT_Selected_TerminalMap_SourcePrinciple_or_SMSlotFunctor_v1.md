# MTT Selected TerminalMap SourcePrinciple or SMSlotFunctor v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_TERMINALMAP_SOURCEPRINCIPLE_CONDITIONAL_ORDERED_SOURCE_CLOSED_SMSLOTFUNCTOR_OPEN`

This artifact imports q79's `TerminalAdmissibleSectionSourcePrinciple` with the
right amount of caution.

## What Closes Under The Explicit Principle

Under the principle, the terminal lane scan selects:

- source label `g3 / L3-K2`;
- `L=(1,-2,0)`;
- `L^2=(2,-4,0)`;
- base order `E1/g1g2` positive and `E2/g3g4` negative;
- visible Chern row `c2(V_alpha)=4 alpha_1`.

The ordered-source validator passes, and the `h1=8` nonzero Ext packet promotes
the rank-two route without observed flavor data or benchmark matrices.

## Why This Is Not Yet Unconditional

The q79 source says the principle should still be promoted into the main MTT
axiomatic spine, or derived from projection/admissibility/gauge-fixing
formalism, before the result is called unconditional.

So the current state is:

```text
TerminalAdmissibleSectionSourcePrinciple
  -> selected terminal source/base order/H1-Ext packet
```

but not yet:

```text
MTT axioms alone
  -> selected terminal source/base order/H1-Ext packet.
```

## Remaining Gates

There are now two clean forward routes:

- promote or derive the terminal admissible-section principle;
- build the selected section-ring/cohomology functor to `10_M`, `bar5_M`,
  and `1_M`, including the `1_M` Dirac rule and overlap normalization.

Route-C remains a bypass if the selected operator response emits the same data
directly.
