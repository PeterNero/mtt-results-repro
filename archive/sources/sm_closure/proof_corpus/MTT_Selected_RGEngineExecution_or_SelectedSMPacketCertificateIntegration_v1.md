# MTT Selected RGEngineExecution or SelectedSMPacketCertificateIntegration v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_RGENGINEEXECUTION_OR_SELECTEDSMPACKETCERTIFICATEINTEGRATION_BUILT_DIAGNOSTIC_RUN_ONLY`.

This artifact adds an executable one-loop SM RG diagnostic engine and runs a
finite smoke test on the current replay packet. The output is deliberately not
accepted as `Y_u(M_Z)`, `Y_d(M_Z)`, `Y_e(M_Z)`, or `lambda_H(M_Z)` because the
threshold, mass-scheme, covariance, and benchmark-validation gates are still
open.

It also rechecks the source-side certificate gate: Qa/SU3 color/operator packet
integration is still open and cannot be replaced by RG replay.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_ThresholdMassSchemeCovarianceFill_or_QaSU3PacketIntegration_v1`.
