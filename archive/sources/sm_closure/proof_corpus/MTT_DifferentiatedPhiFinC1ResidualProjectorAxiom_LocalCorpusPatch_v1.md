# Differentiated PhiFinC1 Residual-Projector Axiom Local Corpus Patch v1

This local proof-corpus patch admits the `DifferentiatedPhiFinC1ResidualProjectorAxiom` as a guarded
axiom for the selected q79/F,m=1 Route-C branch.

Payload:

```text
Phi_fin^C1 applies Q_residual = True
R_Z phase/clock source emitted = True
R_X shift/vertex source emitted = True
b_selected source emitted      = True
```

Replay inside this patched proof spine:

```text
A^T A      = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b      = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0]
rank       = 2
```

Guardrail: this is not yet a derivation from unpatched MTT axioms. It closes the
dynamic C1 packet only inside the explicitly patched proof spine, and it does
not close no-knob flavor constants by itself.
