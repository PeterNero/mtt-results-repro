# MTT Selected DynamicC1TransferTensor or GalerkinC1Values AcceptanceManifest v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_DYNAMICC1TRANSFERTENSOR_OR_GALERKINC1VALUES_ACCEPTANCE_MANIFEST_BUILT_VALUES_OPEN`.

This does not emit new physical values.  It locks the exact target that the
next proof/calculation must fill after the static enriched Weyl-pair provenance
gate:

```text
fixed C1 coordinate system: 4 sectors x 3x3 complex = 72 real coordinates
Lane A: selected same-source dynamic Phi_fin^C1 transfer tensor
Lane B: honest selected Galerkin C1 contraction run
Locked target: A_selected, b_selected, deltaTheta_C1, sector response matrices
```

The current conditional reference remains useful but unpromoted:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta = [1.0, 1.0000000000000002]
```

The superset strategy is now explicit: Lane A and Lane B are different routes,
but both are constrained to emit the same typed 72-real C1 objects.  Neither
observed flavor constants nor target residuals may select the source.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_DynamicC1TransferTensor_ValueEmission_or_HonestGalerkinC1Run_v1`.
