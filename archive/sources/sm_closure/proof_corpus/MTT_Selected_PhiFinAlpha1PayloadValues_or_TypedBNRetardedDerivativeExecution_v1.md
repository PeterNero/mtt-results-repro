# MTT Selected PhiFin Alpha1 Payload Values or TypedBN Retarded Derivative Execution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHIFINALPHA1PAYLOADVALUES_OR_TYPEDBNRETARDEDEXECUTION_BUILT_ALPHA1_RETIRED_DYNAMIC_PAYLOAD_OPEN`

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PrimitiveC1Contractions_or_DynamicPhiFinC1Payload_ValueEmission_v1`

## Result

The same-branch alpha1 derivative and honest dotD replay fields are now filled by
the visible/Route-C alpha1 bridge. This retires alpha1 as the active blocker.

The Lane A validator still correctly fails because the selected dynamic
`Phi_fin/C1` payload values are not emitted. This is not a regression: the
remaining object is now the dynamic payload, not source identity or alpha1.

Lane B typed B_N retarded execution was rechecked and remains support-only.
No observed constants or lifted flags are used as selectors.
