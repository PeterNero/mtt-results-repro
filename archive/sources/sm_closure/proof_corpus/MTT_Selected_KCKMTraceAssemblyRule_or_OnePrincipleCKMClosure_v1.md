# MTT Selected KCKMTraceAssemblyRule or OnePrincipleCKMClosure v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_KCKM_KERNEL_PRINCIPLE_IMPORTED_PI_TRACE_FUNCTIONAL_OPEN`.

## Theorem

`KCKMKernelPrincipleScopeSeparationTheorem` is proved.

The q79 proof repo supplies the selected-kernel principle
`K_CKM^phys = K_sel` at CP-quotient scope. This imports real source ownership
for the CKM CP kernel, but it does not yet define the three angle-magnitude
projectors or their closure-cost trace rows.

```text
K_CKM CP-kernel ownership imported : true
accepted W rows                    : 0/3
remaining Pi_CKM row certificates  : 3
```

The remaining proof object is now sharper than the previous gate:

```text
Pi_CKM^ij closure-cost trace functional on K_sel
Tr_N(Pi_CKM^12 K_sel), Tr_N(Pi_CKM^23 K_sel), Tr_N(Pi_CKM^13 K_sel)
```

CKM angle closure and true SM equivalence are not claimed.
