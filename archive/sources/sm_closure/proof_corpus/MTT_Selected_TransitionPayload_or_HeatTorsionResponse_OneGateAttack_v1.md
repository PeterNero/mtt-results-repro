# MTT Selected TransitionPayload or HeatTorsionResponse OneGateAttack v1

This artifact attacks the primary remaining gate:
`transition_rhoE_or_Cech_Dolbeault_DE_data`.

The result is not a closure, but the gate is now reduced to three legal routes:

1. finite trace identification
2. full selected HYM/Strominger operator replay
3. literal typed monad/Cech payload

What is present:

- nonidentity projective `rho_E` value shape
- 27-mode `D_E`, Riesz/Green, sector projector, and `dotD` value shapes
- local same-source diagonal End0 formula `D_E=d+ad(du*T3)`
- q79 selected trace/gap layer at gap scope

What is missing:

- selected trace equality
- `rho_E_selected_by_mtt`
- full selected Iwasawa/Strominger operator formula or error bound
- literal typed Cech/monad transition payload
- honest replay without diagnostic lifted selected flags

The determinant / heat / torsion slot is deferred until the selected operator
payload is fixed, because otherwise the spectrum would be attached to a
model-active or off-branch operator rather than the selected HYM/End0 source.

Current count remains six closed operator-source slots and two open slots.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_TracePayload_or_FullHYMOperatorEmission_v1`.
