# QFT02 APS Boundary-Crossing Line Reduction

## Result

The first noncollar boundary-phase target is no longer an unspecified complex
number.

For

```text
A(s)=diag(-2,s,3), -1<=s<=1,
```

the exact result is:

```text
spectral flow:                 +1
negative APS rank:             2 -> 1
crossing kernel dimension:     1
minimal stabilization deficit: 1
```

The determinant comparison factors through the crossing line:

```text
det E_-(A(-1))
  = det E_-(A(+1)) tensor det K_cross.
```

A `U(1)` stabilizer fixes the complete operator/projector data while rotating
`K_cross`. Therefore those data cannot select a unit crossing vector or
relative phase.

## Shared-line comparison

There is one exact finite parity shadow:

```text
spectral flow 1
  -> parity 1
  -> 32 in Z64
  -> shared sign -1.
```

This is the unique nontrivial abstract `Z2 -> Z64` comparison. It is not the
full analytic determinant holonomy.

The older neutral-family phase is also excluded as a shortcut: the ordinary
flavor determinant and the Dai-Freed analytic Dirac determinant are different
functorial lines, with no current index/transgression bridge.

## Frontier delta

Before:

```text
noncollar boundary phase = broad eta/Maslov/BFV obligation
```

After:

```text
finite algebraic part = closed exactly
source-free phase choice = impossible
finite parity shadow = -1
physical phase source = one typed boundary-line intertwiner contract
```

Still required:

- a selected physical q79 noncollar boundary family;
- its continuum crossing-kernel line;
- a unitary parallel map to the q79 shared line;
- a boundary classifying path and endpoint comparison;
- analytic determinant transgression;
- eta/Maslov/BFV and counterterm normalization.

No physical parameter, selector, fit or observed input was added.
