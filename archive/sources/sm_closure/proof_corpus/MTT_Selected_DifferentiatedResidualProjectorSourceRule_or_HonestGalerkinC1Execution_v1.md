# MTT Selected DifferentiatedResidualProjectorSourceRule or HonestGalerkinC1Execution v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_DIFFERENTIATEDRESIDUALPROJECTORSOURCERULE_OR_HONESTGALERKINC1EXECUTION_BUILT_SOURCE_RULE_CONTRACT_OPEN`.

The next proof object is now formalized.  The selected source selector and the
canonical projector are both in place, but selector data is not value emission.

The three legal routes are:

```text
A. prove selected differentiated Phi_fin^C1 applies Q_residual
B. promote the enriched Weyl-pair basis-transport/vertex/Hessian source
C. run honest selected Galerkin C1 execution
```

Route B is ranked primary because the enriched Weyl-pair packet is already
algebraically sufficient and its conditional solve has rank
`2` with `deltaTheta=[1.0, 1.0000000000000002]`.

If any legal value-emission route supplies the normal form, the conditional
values are:

```text
A^T A = [[12.0, 0.0], [0.0, 12.0]]
A^T b = [12.0, 12.0]
deltaTheta_C1 = [1.0, 1.0]
```

No observed masses, CKM/PMNS values, CP phase, benchmark matrices, or target
residuals are used as selectors.
