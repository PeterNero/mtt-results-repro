# Selected Qa/SU3 Cech/Dolbeault Matrix Packet Scaffold v1

## Claim

The finite matrix packet shape is now explicit.  The source packet gives five
typed products into `P`, so a minimal formal Cech/Dolbeault scaffold has one
formal generator for each of:

```text
F1..F5, G1..G5, P.
```

This is a scaffold, not a selected-basis claim.

## Matrix Shape

Write the formal `f` entries as:

```text
a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5
```

and the formal `g` entries as:

```text
b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5.
```

Let the five selected multiplication constants into `P` be:

```text
mu_1, mu_2, mu_3, mu_4, mu_5.
```

Then the monad condition reduces to:

```text
mu_1*a_1*b_1 + mu_2*a_2*b_2 + mu_3*a_3*b_3 + mu_4*a_4*b_4 + mu_5*a_5*b_5 = 0.
```

This is the exact algebraic form that selected section/cochain data must
satisfy.

## What This Closes

- The 11 formal spaces are indexed.
- The five typed products are indexed.
- Every product lands in `P` by charge.
- The `g*f=0` equation is explicit.
- The next input shape for the `A01/D_E` operator gate is prepared.

## What Remains Open

The scaffold does not choose values.  It still needs:

```text
selected section or cochain bases,
selected multiplication constants mu_i,
selected f and g entries,
same-source D_E, dotD, or rho_E operator data.
```

Do not choose arbitrary `a_i,b_i,mu_i` to satisfy the equation.  That would be a
convenience solve, not selected MTT data.

The next required artifact is:

```text
Selected_Qa_SU3_Selected_Multiplication_Constants_or_DE_Source_v1
```
