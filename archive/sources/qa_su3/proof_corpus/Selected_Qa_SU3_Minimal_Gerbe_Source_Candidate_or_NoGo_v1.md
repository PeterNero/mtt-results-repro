# Selected `Qa/SU3` Minimal Gerbe Source Candidate or No-Go

The previous gate made the algebraic repair precise:

```text
ordinary (a,b) section algebra + cancelling c-gerbe twisted modules.
```

This note tests whether the existing corpus already supplies the selected
minimal gerbe source needed by that repair.

## Result

The answer is:

```text
candidate route: yes
selected Qa/SU3 source: not yet
no-go: not triggered
```

The flux and Strominger papers support the required kind of object: a
globally meaningful B-field/Deligne gerbe with Bianchi, integrality, fixed
differential-cohomology, twisted Laplacian, and bounded-projector language on
Iwasawa/Strominger-type branches.

The q79 twisted S3 closure supplies a nearby guardrail pattern:

```text
selected flat Deligne class
+ matching twisted Chan-Paton module
+ Freed-Witten cancellation
+ projector-retention check.
```

But this is not automatically a `Qa/SU3` source. Importing it directly would
mix branches.

## Minimal Candidate

The best current candidate is:

```text
a same-branch Qa/SU3 Deligne/Cech or B-field representative
whose twist class maps to c = +/-1 on the twisted module factors,
and cancels pairwise in every monad product.
```

It must supply:

```text
selected_Deligne_Cech_or_B_field_representative_for_Qa_SU3_c_twist,
map_from_representative_to_c_twist_values_minus1_plus1,
same_branch_MTT_selection_of_Qa_SU3_source,
Freed_Witten_cancellation_for_Qa_SU3_twisted_modules,
Green_Schwarz_Bianchi_for_Qa_SU3_source,
twisted_section_bases_from_selected_source,
twisted_multiplication_constants_from_selected_source,
twisted_projector_or_operator_retention.
```

## No-Go Condition

The route should be retired only if the selected MTT gerbe/flux source has
zero restriction to the required `Qa/SU3` c-axis twist class.

We do not have that result. So the route remains live, but unclosed.

## Next Artifact

```text
Selected_Qa_SU3_CTwist_Deligne_Cech_Template_v1
```

This should build the actual typed template:

```text
cover data / Cech cocycle / B-field representative
-> c = +/-1 twist labels
-> twisted module spaces
-> Freed-Witten and Bianchi checks
-> section-ring multiplication table.
```
