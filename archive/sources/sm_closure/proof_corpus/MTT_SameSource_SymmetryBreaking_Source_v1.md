# MTT Same-Source Symmetry-Breaking Source v1

## Result

The same-source symmetry breaker is reduced to the selected
orientation-carrying `D_E/dotD` packet.

This is **superset convergence with repair triage**:

- Straight path: blocked. Current closed invariants are base-swap/Pic0
  insensitive.
- Superset convergence: `SUPERSET_CONVERGENCE_PRIMARY` via
  `SelectedQaSU3OrientationCarryingDEDotDSource.v1`.
- Superset repair: Gauduchon wall remains live but current sources select equal
  radius, not the target wall.
- Superset repair: ordered integral/Appell-Humbert two-block route remains live
  as a source-certificate gap.
- Pic0 rule alone is necessary but not sufficient.
- Diagnostic/backfit: not used as proof.

## Closed

- `selector_obstruction_for_current_closed_invariants`
- `two_block_mod3_shadow_of_ordered_integral_L2`
- `selected_s3_deck_lacks_second_block`
- `target_wall_dictionary`

## Primary Route

Template: `certificates\selected_qa_su3_orientation_carrying_de_dotd_source.template.json`

Why primary: It can break the m=1/m=2 conjugate fork and the visible target-vs-swapped branch while feeding the existing finite D_E/dotD validators.

## Repair Routes

- `gauduchon_wall`: `LIVE_BUT_CURRENT_CORPUS_BLOCKED`; target condition
  `r2^2:r1^2 = 1:2`.
- `ordered_integral_cech_or_appell_humbert`:
  `LIVE_AS_SOURCE_CERTIFICATE_GAP`.
- `pic0_rule_only`: `NECESSARY_BUT_NOT_SUFFICIENT_ALONE`.

## Template Fields

- `source_origin_fields`: freed_witten_and_projector_retention, pic0_selected_or_quotiented, selected_by_mtt, source_certificate, source_kind, visible_bundle_or_twisted_gerbe_source
- `branch_selection_fields`: allowed_torsion_labels, do_not_use_observed_cp_sign, global_cp_label, must_bind_m_to_global_cp_label, selected_torsion_label_m
- `operator_data_fields`: same_branch_derivative_verified, sector_D_E_Riesz_Green_dotD_packets, selected_D_E_action, selected_dotD_alpha1, selected_reduced_green

## Promotion Rule

- selected_by_mtt is true from a source certificate, not lifted flags
- visible_bundle_or_twisted_gerbe_source is true
- Pic0 is selected or physically quotiented
- Freed-Witten and projector retention are preserved
- exactly one torsion label m is selected or antiunitary equivalence is proved with an external retarded boundary selector
- D_E, reduced Green, and dotD validators pass with selected source flags
- dotD is verified as the same-branch alpha1 derivative

## Theorem

`SameSourceSymmetryBreakingSourceReduction` is proved:

The required symmetry-breaking source is not supplied by current topology, h1, finite qutrit, Appell-Humbert, equal-radius, or curvature data. The primary live closure route is the selected orientation-carrying D_E/dotD packet because it can simultaneously choose or quotient the q79/q369 conjugate fork, bind sector orientations to operator domains, and feed the existing D_E, Green, and dotD validators. The wall and ordered-integral routes remain repair paths, but neither currently emits the selected same-source operator response.
