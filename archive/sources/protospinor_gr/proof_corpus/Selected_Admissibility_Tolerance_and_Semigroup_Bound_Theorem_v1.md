# Selected Admissibility Tolerance and Semigroup Bound Theorem v1

## Result

The `C_Q` and `epsilon_adm` gate is reduced to finite internal candidates, but
not yet to a unique physical branch.

Current executable candidate family:

```text
C_Q = 1
epsilon_adm = 1/N
N in {64, 79, 448}
```

With `lambda_star=15` and normalized internal alpha:

| N | epsilon_adm | log(C_Q/epsilon_adm) | Lambda_eff internal | R1 internal |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 0.015625 | 4.15888308335967 | 1.89914128021651 | 0.526553769546832 |
| 79 | 0.0126582278481013 | 4.36944785246702 | 1.85281624239624 | 0.539718930090284 |
| 448 | 0.00223214285714286 | 6.10479323241498 | 1.56750938592616 | 0.637954712729934 |

All three candidates pass the internal `R1 <= 2` central-circle admissibility
test.

## Interpretation

This is progress, but not physical closure. The current sources support these
as finite-resolution candidates:

```text
N=64   exact dyadic Z64 carrier
N=79   selected q79 label scaffold
N=448  combined Z64 x Z7 quotient candidate
```

The corpus does not yet prove that one of these is the unique physical
`Omega_0` branch, nor that `C_Q=1` is the sharp physical semigroup bound.

## Remaining Gate

To close this part, we need one of:

```text
Selected_Finite_Resolution_Branch_Theorem
Selected_Sharp_Semigroup_Bound_Theorem
Selected_Basin_Separation_Tolerance_Theorem
```

No observed Newton, Planck, cosmological, TeV, or particle-mass value is used.
