# Selected Qa/SU3 Endomorphism or Local System Torsion Decision v1

## Inputs

The local A01 repair guardrail gives one important algebraic fact:

```text
repair B: B1=E13, B2=-E32, B3=E12 passes full Maurer-Cartan.
```

But it is not source-certified. It therefore stays an erratum candidate, not a
proof source.

## Lane Decision

| lane | status | reason |
|---|---|---|
| A01 repair B | blocked | full-MC integrable, but source selection and finite response are absent |
| endomorphism_E threshold operator | live/open | correct operator style, but matrix blocks and finite part are absent |
| selected local-system torsion | live/open | allowed finite response, but no selected Qa/SU3 `rho_E` is present |
| projective gerbe/twisted module response | primary/open | already solves the literal `c` obstruction at typing level |

## Correct Way Forward

Build the selected gerbe/twisted local-system response interface. It must combine

```text
selected Deligne/Cech or B-field class,
ordinary a,b section factors,
c-twisted F_i/G_i modules,
twisted multiplication constants,
Freed-Witten and Bianchi admissibility,
projector and zero-mode policy,
and one finite response: D_E, rho_E, heat/zeta, or torsion.
```

The endomorphism_E and local-system torsion lanes stay live as fallback exits.
They should not be filled by observed constants or off-branch q79 data.
