# MTT Selected FirstValueSourceRowFill or ExternalThresholdSourceImport v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FIRSTVALUESOURCEROWFILL_OR_EXTERNALTHRESHOLDSOURCEIMPORT_BUILT_FIRST_ROW_NUMERIC_SOURCE_PROMOTION_OPEN`.

This artifact emits the first numeric value-source row candidate:

```text
row id: VSD-01.phase.I_plus_Z.u_e.first_dynamic_row
route : phase packet I+Z routed to u,e
```

It passes the conditional non-scalar checks, but it is not accepted as a
selected MTT dynamic value-source row.

```text
numeric first row filled: true
accepted as selected source row: false
external threshold row imported: false
```

The blocker is now pure source promotion: selected dynamic transfer,
Hessian/b_selected, or honest Galerkin primitive-row provenance.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_FirstValueSourceRowPromotion_or_HonestGalerkinPrimitiveRow_v1`.
