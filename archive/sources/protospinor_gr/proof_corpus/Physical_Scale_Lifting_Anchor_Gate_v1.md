# Physical Scale-Lifting Anchor Gate v1

## Result

The non-SM constants repo now supplies the internal scale-lifting data needed by
the GR normalization program:

```text
R_star          = 4.440528182269818
rho_UV          = 0.164530397543639
s_star_from_rho = 1.464646774701829
```

This imports the selected H2 horizontal scale law and the selected
character-channel covariance closure.

## What This Closes

The internal MTT branch is no longer waiting for `Q_tau` in this selected
character-channel route. In normalized exact-branch units, the internal scale
lift is available.

## What It Does Not Close

It still does not predict the measured Newton constant or Planck scale.
`rho_UV` and `s_star` are dimensionless internal quantities. They do not by
themselves supply the conversion from canonical internal action units to SI
length, mass, or action units.

The remaining physical gate is:

```text
target-independent dimensional anchor
```

No observed `G_N`, `M_Pl`, `H0`, `rho_DE`, or other target dimensionful constant
may be used to set this anchor.
