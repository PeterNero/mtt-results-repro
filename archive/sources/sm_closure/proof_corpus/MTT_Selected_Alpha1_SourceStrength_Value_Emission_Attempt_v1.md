# MTT Selected Alpha1 Source-Strength Value Emission Attempt v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ALPHA1_SOURCE_STRENGTH_VALUE_EMISSION_ATTEMPT_BUILT_VALUE_OPEN`.

## Emission Attempt

The strongest local value candidate is:

```text
lambda_alpha1 = 1
du/dalpha1 = h_ext
```

with:

```text
||h_ext||_L2 = 0.03961411527057935
residual_L2 = 6.751979459438445e-13
min(h_ext) = -0.10754505879113498
max(h_ext) = 0.051537511442212844
mean_abs(h_ext) = 2.355797313054923e-19
```

This is the natural unit source-strength coordinate for the selected local
transport derivative.  It is not yet emitted as a selected MTT value, because
the branch has not supplied the same-source source-strength normalization or a
typed `B_N` retarded-overlap derivative.

## Route Results

- Route A isolates the unit candidate but rejects promotion by convention alone.
- Route B needs the same-source packet/transfer normalization; selected fields
  remain open.
- Route C has retarded-kernel pattern support but no typed q79 `B_N` dotD
  derivative.
- Route D says the validator would pass if flags were theorem-derived, but the
  probe remains diagnostic.

No observed constants, benchmark matrices, target fits, or lifted flags are
used.
