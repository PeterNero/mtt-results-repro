# MTT Selected ValueSourceDerivationObligationKernel or ExternalThresholdImportManifest v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_VALUESOURCEDERIVATIONOBLIGATIONKERNEL_OR_EXTERNALTHRESHOLDIMPORTMANIFEST_BUILT_KERNEL_AND_IMPORT_MANIFEST_VALUES_OPEN`.

This artifact fixes the remaining source-row problem into a typed obligation
kernel and an external import manifest.

```text
required rows = 5
closed rows   = 0
first target  = VSD-01-selected-overlap-value-kernel
```

It also records that existing static overlap/readout/C1/residual support maps
into the obligations but closes none of them.

Promotion decision:

```text
obligation kernel closed: true
external import manifest closed: true
selected dynamic value-source rows emitted: false
accepted external threshold rows imported: false
true SM equivalence: open
```

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_FirstValueSourceRowFill_or_ExternalThresholdSourceImport_v1`.
