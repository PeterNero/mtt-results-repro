# Selected Qa/SU3 C-Twist Period Normalization or A01 Exit v1

## Claim

The absolute `c = +/-1` period-normalization problem reduces to a single
scalar gate on the isotropic Iwasawa branch, but the current corpus does not
select that scalar or a same-branch finite quotient.  Therefore the gerbe route
stays live but unpromoted, and the selected `A01/D_E` operator exit becomes
required in parallel.

## Scalar Gate

The transgression computation suppresses the positive Iwasawa scale

```text
A = r3/(r1*r2).
```

On the isotropic branch `r1 = r2 = R`, the flux paper gives

```text
r3^2 = 8*(2*pi)^2 / (16/alpha_prime + 8/R^4).
```

Therefore

```text
A^2 = (r3/R^2)^2
    = (2*pi)^2 / (1 + 2*R^4/alpha_prime).
```

The condition that the scaled primitive transgression generator is the absolute
unit generator is:

```text
A=1 iff R^4 = alpha_prime*((2*pi)^2 - 1)/2.
```

This is a sharp result: the missing normalization is no longer vague.  It is
either a same-branch selection of this ratio, or an equivalent same-branch
finite central quotient.

## Route Test

The Iwasawa flux source supplies trace normalization, quantized flux language,
global gerbe language, and integral periods.  That is enough to make the
period-unit question meaningful.  It is not enough to select the primitive
`c`-unit, because the same paper also says an overall volume/shape modulus
remains in the invariant first-order analysis.

The q79/S3 finite torsion class supplies a useful pattern for finite central
normalization, but it is still off branch.  Importing it directly would mix the
q79/S3 source with the Qa/SU3 Iwasawa monad packet.

The M-theory integrality corpus supports the idea that MTT topological sectors
can select integral cohomology lattices, but it does not yet give a pushdown to
the Qa/SU3 central `c` quotient.

## What This Closes

- The absolute period normalization is reduced to the scalar condition `A=1`.
- On the isotropic Iwasawa branch this is equivalent to a concrete ratio
  `R^4/alpha_prime = ((2*pi)^2 - 1)/2`.
- Integral periods are recorded as necessary but insufficient for selecting the
  primitive `c`-twist unit.
- The q79/S3 finite torsion result remains a guardrail, not a proof import.
- The `A01/D_E` operator exit is now required if no same-branch period selector
  is found.

## What Remains Open

The proof still needs one of:

```text
same-branch selector for R^4/alpha_prime or A,
same-branch finite central quotient,
selected A01/D_E operator matrices.
```

The next required artifact is:

The parallel search artifact is:
