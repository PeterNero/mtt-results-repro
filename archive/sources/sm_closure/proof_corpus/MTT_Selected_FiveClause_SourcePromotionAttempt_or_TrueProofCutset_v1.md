# MTT Selected FiveClause SourcePromotionAttempt or TrueProofCutset v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_FIVECLAUSE_SOURCEPROMOTION_ATTEMPT_BUILT_TRUEPROOFCUTSET_OPEN`.

All available clause-specific support has now been imported:

```text
finite trace measure normalization = closed
finite selected C1 quotient        = closed
selected basis independence        = closed
phase/shift shape compatibility    = closed
formal Hessian target              = closed
all 110 algebraic values           = closed
```

The strict source validator still rejects the promotion attempt. This means the
remaining proof is not a value problem, a row-count problem, or a measure
normalization problem.

There are now two legal exits:

```text
Route A: physical Phi_fin^C1 action restriction theorem
Route B: independent row-kernel source theorem
```

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_PhysicalPhiFinC1ActionRestriction_or_IndependentRowKernelSourceTheorem_v1`.
