  We try to prove the remaining selected-source claim for the already computed
  qutrit Fourier transport packet.  The finite geometry is closed: clock and
  shift qutrit polarizations are related by the Fourier matrix, and the Route B
  object is exactly Delta_t=(1/sqrt(3),omega^2/sqrt(3)).  The current corpus,
  however, still does not promote U_10=I_3 and U_bar5=F to selected MTT data:
  the strongest packet is an UNSELECTED_FIXTURE, the Z3 gerbe map is finite but
  not selected, and no monad/Cech or spectral Galerkin zero-mode source supplies
  the sector bases.  The correct solution is a selected Gerbe-Fourier
  polarization promotion packet or an equivalent selected zero-mode derivation.

  Selected Fourier Transport Proof Attempt

# Target

The requested theorem is:

```text
MTT geometry selects U_10 = I_3 and U_bar5 = F
for the q79 SU(5) qutrit transport packet.
```

This cannot use:

```text
observed CKM data,
observed masses,
Execution II benchmark flavor entries,
common Fourier gauge rotation,
SU(3) exterior-square monomial duality.
```

# What Is Proved

The finite part is genuinely proved:

```text
clock polarization -> shift polarization = F,
F^dagger Z F = X,
F^dagger X F = Z^-1.
```

The exact Route B object is also computed:

```text
Delta_t = (1/sqrt(3), omega^2/sqrt(3)).
```

The strongest finite packet has:

```text
U_10 = I_3,
U_bar5 = F,
10_M = clock,
bar5_M = shift.
```

It passes the finite validator.

# What Does Not Yet Promote

The same packet is still marked:

```text
UNSELECTED_FIXTURE.
```

The current selected-source routes do not close:

```text
selected gerbe/twisted-bundle source: selection open,
flat torsion label: nontrivial pair {1,2}, unique label open,
orientation-carrying D_E/dotD: absent,
typed monad/Cech zero modes: absent,
spectral Galerkin/Riesz zero modes: absent,
Route C selected residual source: absent.
```

So the requested selected proof is not yet present in the current corpus.

# Correct Solution

The right closing theorem is:

```text
Selected Gerbe-Fourier Polarization Promotion.
```

A passing selected source packet must provide:

```text
selected_by_mtt = true,
fixed differential-cohomology torsion label m=1 for q79
  or an antiunitary-equivalent conjugate proof,
map_to_central_cocycle_verified = true,
Green-Schwarz Bianchi verified,
Freed-Witten verified,
twisted_projector_retains_sector = true,
coherent_spectral_projector_verified = true,
common family frame and selected L2 metrics,
U_10 and U_bar5,
U_10^dagger U_bar5 = F modulo rephasing/permutation.
```

Once that packet exists, the selected Fourier transport proof is immediate
from the already-proved finite qutrit lemma.

# Verdict

The honest current status is:

```text
finite Fourier transport: proved,
exact Route B object: computed,
selected Fourier transport from MTT geometry: not yet proved,
correct selected-source packet: identified.
```

This is progress, but not full SM closure.
