# MTT Selected HLambda Overlap Kernel Row or Scalar Omega Execution Gate v1

## Purpose

This artifact separates the strict and controlled tiers at the H/lambda wall.
It follows the nine charged normalized HYM/Strominger overlap-kernel rows.

## Strict Tier

Strict no-knob status remains:

- selected charged overlap-kernel rows: `9`
- selected strict `K_threshold` rows: `9`
- required `K_threshold` rows: `10`
- selected H/lambda overlap-kernel row emitted: `false`
- strict `Omega/lambda_H` scalar execution closed: `false`

The missing strict object is still a selected H/lambda overlap-kernel row,
strict `R_H^RG`, direct `K_threshold.Omega_H.lambda`, or an equivalent selected
H quartic/threshold source theorem.

## Controlled Tier

The controlled one-parameter tier is now explicit:

- primitive: `UP-RET-OVERLAP.HRG`
- calibrated value: `391.39140285811936`
- log value: `5.969708089616292`
- conditional controlled `K_threshold` count: `10`
- `lambda_H` is calibration, not prediction: `true`
- strict no-knob claim allowed: `false`

The controlled H row is:

```text
(1.193869931683266) / D_fin.H
```

with allowed use: `controlled empirical replay/import only`.

## Theorem

`HLambdaTierSeparatedScalarGateTheorem`: strict H/lambda remains open at 9/10,
while the declared one-parameter controlled tier can build a parameterized 10/10
gate.  The two tiers must not be conflated.

## What This Closes

- strict H/lambda gate reconciled after nine charged overlap rows
- controlled one-parameter H layer imported into the current frontier
- parameterized controlled 10/10 K gate recorded separately from strict no-knob tier
- lambda_H calibration/prediction boundary locked

## What Remains Open

- strict selected H/lambda overlap-kernel row
- strict selected `R_H^RG` or H quartic/threshold source theorem
- cross-use prediction audit for `UP-RET-OVERLAP.HRG`
- non-Higgs threshold/RG prediction using the same calibrated primitive
- strict `Omega/lambda_H` scalar execution
- true SM equivalence
