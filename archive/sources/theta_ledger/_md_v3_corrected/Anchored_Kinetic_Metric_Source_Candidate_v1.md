  We propose the first same-source candidate for the non-circulant family
  metric required by CKM magnitudes.  The corrected corpus already separates a
  stiff lens sector from a softer nil/termination sector, and the book-aligned
  proto-spinor language reads anchoring as mass-like closure cost.  We combine
  these clues into an anchored diagonal kinetic metric on the retained Z3
  family basis.  In normalized gap units, the candidate family costs are
  J=(0, lambda_nil/lambda_lens, 1), with the nil direction setting the anchor
  scale and the lens direction suppressed by its larger gap.  This metric is
  positive and non-circulant, breaks the pure bridge common Fourier basis, and
  therefore supplies the kind of selected family anisotropy required by the
  kinetic-breaking gate.  It remains a source candidate until the actual MTT
  theta/lens/nil/proto-spinor localization operator derives the anchor order
  and sector scale.

  Anchored Kinetic Metric Source Candidate from Lens/Nil Gap Hierarchy

# Purpose

The bridge-reduced packet proved a useful no-go:

```text
pure Z3 bridge symmetry -> common family-Fourier left basis -> no CKM angles.
```

The selected kinetic-breaking gate showed the required cure:

```text
derive a non-circulant selected kinetic/localization metric.
```

This note proposes the first corpus-grounded source candidate for that metric.

# Corpus Clues

The corrected theta-closure papers give:

```text
lambda_lens >= 3.57    in normalized units,
lambda_nil  >= 0.25    as the conservative nil floor.
```

The same corpus repeatedly treats nil as the termination/survivor sector and
lens as a stiffer localization layer.

The book-aligned proto-spinor language adds the structural reading:

```text
anchoring is mass-like closure cost;
termination marks where refinement stops and anchoring begins.
```

These are not yet a full derivation, but they identify the right kind of
source for family anisotropy.

# Candidate Metric

On the retained family basis:

```text
f in Z3 = {0,1,2},
```

assign the normalized anchor-cost profile:

```text
J(0) = 0,
J(1) = lambda_nil / lambda_lens,
J(2) = 1.
```

With the corpus values:

```text
J ~= (0, 0.25/3.57, 1)
  ~= (0, 0.0700, 1).
```

Define a sector kinetic metric:

```text
G_x(f,f) = exp(2 s_x J(f)),
```

where `s_x > 0` is a sector scale that must eventually be derived from the
selected theta/lens/nil/proto-spinor operator.  In the minimal candidate check
we use normalized units `s_x=1`.

# Why This Breaks the Pure Bridge No-Go

A circulant metric on `Z3` is invariant under family translation.  A diagonal
metric in the family localization basis is circulant only when all diagonal
entries are equal.

Here:

```text
G(0,0) != G(1,1) != G(2,2).
```

Therefore the metric is not family-circulant.  Canonical normalization by this
metric breaks the common family-Fourier diagonalization of pure bridge
matrices.

# Theorem: Anchored Metric Supplies Admissible Family Breaking

Assume MTT selects the retained family basis and the cost profile `J` above
from theta/lens/nil/proto-spinor closure data.  Then the metric:

```text
G = diag(exp(2J(0)), exp(2J(1)), exp(2J(2)))
```

is positive and non-circulant, and therefore is an admissible source of
selected family breaking for CKM magnitudes.

Proof.  Positivity follows from the exponential form.  Non-circulance follows
because the three diagonal entries are unequal.  Since pure bridge Hermitian
forms are family-circulant and share the Fourier basis, inserting this metric
into canonical normalization produces Hermitian forms that need not remain in
the circulant algebra.  Thus the common-basis obstruction is removed.

# What This Closes

```text
corpus-grounded family anisotropy candidate       FORMULATED
positive non-circulant metric                     PROVED
pure bridge no-go escape route                    PROVED/CHECKED
lens/nil gap hierarchy used without mass input    CHECKED
```

# What Remains

```text
derive anchor ordering f=0,1,2 from MTT            OPEN
derive sector scale s_x                            OPEN
derive whether Q,u,d share or differ in J_x        OPEN
compute actual normalized CKM matrix               OPEN
extend metric source to lepton/neutrino sectors    OPEN
```

# Bottom Line

The next missing object has become very specific:

```text
MTT must derive an anchored family cost profile J_x(f)
from theta/lens/nil/proto-spinor closure.
```

If it does, the bridge-reduced packet has a same-source route to CKM
magnitudes without entry-wise Yukawa fitting.
