# MTT Selected PhysicalSourceEmission PatchBackimport or UnpatchedDerivation v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_PHYSICALSOURCEEMISSION_PATCHBACKIMPORT_BUILT_UNPATCHED_DERIVATION_OPEN`.

The new physical boundary/first-variation validator is stricter than the older
contract, but it is consistent with the existing patched dynamic C1 closure:
after the explicit `SelectedFiniteC1TraceMeasurePrinciple` patch, the finite
Weyl trace rows promote to physical Route-B Galerkin rows and provide patched
`A_selected`, `b_selected`, `deltaTheta_C1`, and sector response matrices.

This does **not** claim full SM parity or no-knob closure. It says dynamic C1 is
retired as a blocker only inside the patched SM-parity spine. The unpatched
frontier remains: derive the finite C1 trace-measure principle, derive the
direct physical `Phi_fin^C1` action identity, or emit the Route-A same-source
source packet.

Next artifact: `MTT_Selected_FinalSMParityGapMatrix_or_UnpatchedFiniteC1MeasureDerivation_v1`.
