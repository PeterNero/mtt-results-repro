# MTT Selected Alpha1 HRG Selector or A_EW Metrology Value Source Theorem v1

Status: `MTT_SELECTED_ALPHA1HRGSELECTOR_OR_AEWMETROLOGYVALUESOURCETHEOREM_ATTEMPTED_EXACT_DEFICIT_LOCKED_SOURCE_OPEN`

## What Just Locked

The exact diagnostic equality is now treated as a source obligation, not as a
source row:

```text
lambda_Mt / (A_EW*s_beta) = 391.39140285811936
UP_RET_OVERLAP.HRG        = 391.39140285811936
residual                  = 0.0
```

Equivalently:

```text
required A_EW             = 26.810838207045368
external A_EW             = 0.0685013467625
required/external A_EW    = 391.39140285811936
HRG residual              = 0.0
```

So the missing object is not another plain electroweak coordinate row.  It is a
selected HRG-sized threshold/transport/source object.

## Alpha1 HRG Selector

The prioritized alpha/source-strength lane was replayed:

```text
lambda_alpha1 candidate   = 1.0
h_ext L2                  = 0.03961411527057935
h_ext residual L2         = 6.751979459438445e-13
same-branch alpha bridge  = True
alpha1 driver verified    = True
honest dotD replay exit   = 0
dynamic Phi_fin/C1 payload= False
typed B_N derivative      = false
typed HRG consumer map    = false
same-HRG prediction       = false
```

The same-branch alpha1 derivative and honest dotD replay are already retired by
the latest visible/Route-C bridge.  They still do not select HRG.  The remaining
alpha-side object is the selected dynamic Phi_fin/C1 payload or an equivalent
typed B_N retarded source, followed by a typed HRG consumer map.

## A_EW Value Source

The A_EW metrology route also remains source-open:

```text
selected A_EW             = false
selected mu_match         = false
selected threshold/RG     = false
selected large factor     = false
external WZH rows         = 5
selected R_theta rows     = 0
```
