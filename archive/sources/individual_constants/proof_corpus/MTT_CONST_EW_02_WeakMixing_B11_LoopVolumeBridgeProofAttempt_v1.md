# MTT CONST EW 02 Weak Mixing B11 Loop Volume Bridge Proof Attempt v1

Status: `MTT_CONST_EW_02_B11_CONDITIONAL_BRIDGE_PROVED_STRICT_SOURCE_OBSTRUCTION`

Label: `CONST-EW-02 / WEAK-MIXING / B11-LOOP-VOLUME-BRIDGE-PROOF-ATTEMPT`

## What Was Proved

The conditional bridge is now theorem-level:

```text
if x*log(mu_Theta/MZ) = sqrt(15/log(448)),
then y = sqrt(15/log(448))/(8*pi^2)
```

and B9 gives:

```text
y = 0.019852738294064105
sin2_no_threshold_one_loop = 0.2315309482915084
```

No weak-angle observation is used as a selector.

## What Was Not Proved

The strict bridge:

```text
x*log(mu_Theta/MZ) = sqrt(15/log(448))
```

is not yet proved from the current corpus.  The right-hand side is sourced, but
the current packets do not source `x`, `L`, or their product.

This is a rigorous current-source obstruction, not merely a missing numerical
calculation.  For any positive `x`, one may choose `L=C/x`; for any positive
`L`, one may choose `x=C/L`.  Therefore a source theorem must emit the product.

## Diagnostic Only

Using the old `5 TeV` scaffold gives:

```text
L = 4.004274268492299
x_required = 0.3914590462147254
g2_required = 0.6256668811873659
```

This is not a selection theorem.
