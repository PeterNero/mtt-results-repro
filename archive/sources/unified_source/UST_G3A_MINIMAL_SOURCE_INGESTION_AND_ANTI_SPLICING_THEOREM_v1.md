# UST.G3A Minimal Physical-Source Ingestion and Anti-Splicing Theorem v1

**Date:** 2026-08-03

**Status:** `EXACT_INGESTION_AND_ANTI_SPLICING_CONTRACT_CURRENT_PROMOTABLE_CANDIDATES_ZERO`

## 1. Purpose

`UST.G1E` gives seven tests for reverse physical representability. This theorem
answers two operational questions:

1. how many independent upstream source objects those seven tests require;
2. whether already certified rows from different q79 candidates may be joined
   to manufacture a physical endpoint.

The answer is four primitive geometric source rows, at most one separately
declared positive normalization ray unless it is derived, and one same-source
finite readout map. Rows from different source orbits cannot be spliced without
a certified structure-preserving transport. No current candidate passes the
resulting ingestion gate.

## 2. Minimal Primitive Source Tuple

Fix the q79 background, branch and shared differential line. The endpoint
source tuple is

\[
\mathcal P_*
=\left(U_{\eta9},W_9^\tau,\mathfrak c_+,\nabla^{TX}\right)_{[s_*]},
\]

where:

1. `U_eta9` is the selected characteristic-zero visible differential-Picard
   source, including the flat Deligne decision and inverse-transform data;
2. `W9^tau` is the selected twisted-holomorphic locally free hidden carrier;
3. `c_+` is one common positive Gauduchon/Hermitian chamber, with relative
   field normalization declared;
4. `nabla_TX` is the selected tangent-connection convention and connection.

These are geometric objects, not four empirical scalar fit parameters. Their
moduli must be reported. If the selected geometry does not fix the overall
repair/action normalization, one additional `lambda_act in R_+` scale ray must
be bound explicitly; it is not silently counted as derived. The finite readout

\[
T_{\mathrm{fin}}:\mathfrak S_*\longrightarrow\mathfrak F_*
\]

is a fifth certificate object, not an independent endpoint field.

## 3. Seven Rows From Four Primitives

The reverse-representability rows depend on the primitive tuple as follows.

| Row | Required primitive data | Derived decision |
|---|---|---|
| amplitude | `U_eta9`, `W9^tau` | transformed cohomology concentrated in the claimed bundle degrees |
| local freeness | `U_eta9`, `W9^tau` | locally free ranks 3 and 9 |
| topology | `U_eta9`, `W9^tau` | determinant, Chern and twist rows |
| augmentation | all four | full triangular complex, connecting map and anomaly convention |
| metric | `c_+`, `nabla_TX`, `lambda_act` if independent | pairing, adjoints, domains and normalization |
| dynamics | all four, `lambda_act` if independent | complete physical residual, gauge action, higher products and `K` |
| readout | all four, normalization, `T_fin` | same-source finite commuting map and error certificate |

Thus `K=DR_phys(s_*)` is a derived output of the dynamics row. It is not a
fifth freely selectable continuum matrix. Once `K` is emitted, `UST.G2` fixes

\[
H_{\mathrm{phys}}=\Delta_{\mathcal Y,1}+K^\dagger K.
\]

## 4. Evidence Grades

Every row has exactly one grade:

- `PASS`: candidate-specific, hash-bound evidence discharges the complete row;
- `FAIL`: a candidate-specific exact obstruction contradicts the row;
- `PARTIAL`: exact evidence covers only a sector or strict substructure;
- `CONDITIONAL`: a theorem applies only after an unmet hypothesis;
- `OPEN`: no accepted candidate-specific evidence;
- `NOT_SOURCE`: the object is a template or downstream shadow, not an endpoint.

Only `PASS` counts toward promotion. A candidate is promotable only when all
seven rows pass, all primitive, normalization and readout certificates carry
one source-orbit identifier, and every artifact hash is locked. The
normalization state must be `DERIVED` or `BOUND`; `MISSING` prevents promotion.

## 5. Anti-Splicing Theorem

Let `D` be the same-source representation diagram in
`docs/SOURCE_CERTIFICATE.md`. A physical source certificate is a point of the
homotopy limit of `D`, equivalently a compatible cone over its claimed nodes.

Suppose row certificates are taken from source orbits `s_i`. They define one
source certificate only if either:

1. every `s_i` is the same orbit; or
2. explicit transports `F_ij` identify the orbits while preserving every
   structure used by the rows, including topology, differential, connection,
   pairing, nonlinear residual, gauge action and finite readout.

Without these maps there is no cone and therefore no homotopy-limit point.
Equal terminal dimensions or numerical matrices do not repair this defect.

If a preserved discrete invariant differs, no such transport can exist. In
particular, a connection deformation, HYM flow or cohesive-superconnection
perturbation cannot change the underlying K-class or integral Chern rows.

## 6. Current Candidate Audit

### Reference Hull-Strominger bundle pair

The reference pair is an ordinary locally free rank-3/rank-9 bundle pair and
supplies reference HYM/metric structure. It fails physical topology:

```text
reference visible: c3 = 0
physical visible:  c3 = +/-6
reference hidden:  pullback K3 c2 = 11
physical hidden:   nonbasic P(3,9) row -9u
```

It is excluded as the physical gauge endpoint. Its geometric metric data may
remain initialization evidence, but cannot be copied into a physical source
certificate without a new transport theorem.

### Cohesive `S_HS/kappa_hol` benchmark

This benchmark supplies a genuine global cohesive DGA and canonical
Maurer-Cartan curvature. Its conditional inverse object has

\[
(c_1,c_2)(\kappa_{hol})=(-H,3u),
\]

not the visible physical rows `(0,9u)`, and it does not supply the complete
physical `V3/W9` pair. It is excluded from direct promotion, not from use as a
structural benchmark.

### Hidden `P(3,9)` topological endpoint

The selected smooth-projective K-class and determinant rows close a hidden
topological subproblem. Holomorphic local freeness, common-chamber HYM,
physical dynamics and finite transport remain open. It is partial evidence,
not a complete source candidate.

### Smooth projective V3/W9 cohomological pair

The two-sector smooth-projective pair has the retained visible and hidden
Chern, determinant and twist rows, so its topology row passes. It is not yet a
selected holomorphic or cohesive endpoint. Holomorphic local freeness, the
common Gauduchon/HYM chamber and physical connections remain open. The
complete residual and finite-transfer formulas apply conditionally once those
source rows exist; they do not promote the pair by themselves.

The strict current result is therefore

\[
\boxed{N_{\mathrm{promotable}}=0.}
\]

This is not a negative verdict on the intended physical source. It prevents
the current incomplete objects from being silently combined into one.

## 7. Ingestion Algorithm

An upstream packet is accepted only after the verifier:

1. matches its source paths and hashes to the locked repository commit;
2. validates one source-orbit identifier across the four primitives;
3. checks all seven evidence grades and their artifact references;
4. rejects every `PARTIAL`, `CONDITIONAL`, `OPEN` or `NOT_SOURCE` row for
   promotion;
5. rejects any `FAIL` row immediately;
6. validates the `T_fin` commuting square and exact/error certificate;
7. only then instantiates `K`, the corrected Hodge operator and its harmonic
   projector.

The machine-readable schema and current audit packet implement this rule.

## 8. Frontier Delta

Closed now:

- four-primitive dependency reduction of the seven physical rows;
- exact evidence-grade semantics;
- same-source anti-splicing theorem;
- machine-readable UST.G3 ingestion schema;
- exact exclusion of the two tempting benchmark substitutions;
- current candidate count `0` at strict promotion tier.

Still open:

- all four primitive rows on one physical source orbit;
- the same-source finite readout map;
- the physical `K`, target metric and corrected spectrum;
- `B.HS.01`, `B.OP.01` and `B.ACTION.01`.

This closes `UST.G3A`, not `UST.G3`.
