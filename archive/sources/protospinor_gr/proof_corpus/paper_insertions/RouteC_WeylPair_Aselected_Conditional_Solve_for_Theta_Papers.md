## Conditional Solve

Conditioned on theorem-derived selected emission of the two Weyl-pair columns,
the operator

```text
A_weylpair_conditional = [phase_packet, shift_packet]
```

has shape `72 x 2`, rank `2`, and solves the locked splitter equation with
`deltaTheta=(1,1)` up to numerical roundoff. This removes the algebraic rank
obstruction at the Weyl-pair layer.

## Proof Boundary

This is not yet `A_selected`. The source provenance lemma remains required:
the selected Route-C source must emit the phase-like `I+Z` basis-holonomy
packet and the shift-like `I+X` active-vertex packet from the same branch,
without observed masses, CKM/PMNS, CP phase, lifted flags, or benchmark
matrices.
