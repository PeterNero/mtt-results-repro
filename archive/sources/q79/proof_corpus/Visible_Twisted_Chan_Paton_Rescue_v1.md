title: "Visible Twisted Chan-Paton Rescue for the Coordinate D7 Route"
author: "Peter Nero"

abstract: |
  The ordinary zero-DD coordinate D7 route is blocked: no placement of the two
  active qutrit generators into factorized coordinate directions makes all
  three D7 divisors S1,S2,S3 isotropic.  This note tests the next finite
  possibility.  If the two active generators occupy two distinct coordinate
  factors, then every matter curve Cij has rank at most one active image, while
  exactly one D7 divisor sees the full F3^2 plane.  The already validated
  qutrit projective carrier supplies a full-F3^2 projective module with the
  same zeta3 twist as the selected q79/F,m=1 gerbe table.  Hence the coordinate
  route has a conditional finite rescue: one D7 stack may carry twisted
  Chan-Paton/projective-bundle data, while the other D7 stacks and all matter
  curves stay ordinary/isotropic.  Selection, geometric source, HYM/operator
  source, projector retention, and D_E/dotD remain open.

# Purpose

The previous calculation proved:

```text
ordinary zero-DD coordinate D7 route = blocked.
```

This note asks whether the coordinate D7 route can be rescued by allowing the
rank-two-pullback D7 stack to carry the qutrit projective Chan-Paton module.

# Finite Input

The time-oriented m=1 period table gives a nontrivial flat gerbe class on:

```text
F3^2.
```

The existing projective carrier gives:

```text
X Z = omega Z X,
projective gerbe gluing = passes,
strict ordinary vector-bundle gluing = fails,
central twist = omega^2 in the mesh convention.
```

This is exactly the finite algebra expected of a twisted Chan-Paton module for
the qutrit gerbe pullback.

# Enumeration

For the coordinate factors T1,T2,T3, put e1 and e2 in distinct factors.  There
are six ordered assignments.

In each such assignment:

```text
all three matter curves C12,C23,C31 have rank <= 1 active image,
two D7 divisors have rank <= 1 active image,
one D7 divisor has rank 2 active image.
```

Thus the minimal coordinate rescue is:

```text
one twisted/projective D7 stack,
two ordinary/isotropic D7 stacks,
three ordinary/isotropic matter curves.
```

Equivalently, the remaining discrete choice is which D7 stack receives the
projective qutrit Chan-Paton module:

```text
S1 or S2 or S3,
with qutrit orientation e1/e2 still ordered.
```

# What This Changes

The coordinate route is not rescued as an ordinary vector-bundle route.  It is
rescued only as a conditional projective/twisted route.

This is important because it gives a mathematically precise next target:

```text
select one twisted D7 stack and promote the projective module to a geometric
Deligne/Cech or worldvolume-flux/Chan-Paton source.
```

# What Remains Open

This does not prove full Freed-Witten closure.  It leaves:

```text
selected choice of S1/S2/S3,
geometric B-field/gerbe representative on that stack,
worldvolume flux or twisted Chan-Paton source certificate,
HYM or Route-C selected visible operator source,
projector retention,
D_E/dotD/Riesz/Green,
primitive C1 contractions and SM closure.
```

# Conclusion

The next proof target is no longer vague.  Either:

```text
1. select a non-coordinate/isotropic active-image map,
```

or, more strongly for the current coordinate CY corner:

```text
2. select exactly one projective D7 stack carrying the qutrit twisted
   Chan-Paton module.
```

The second route is now finite-algebraically coherent, but still unpromoted.
